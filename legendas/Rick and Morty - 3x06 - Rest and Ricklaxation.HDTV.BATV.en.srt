1
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:03,635
So, Jessica,
I heard you broke up with Brad.

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,504
Who are you gonna date
now that you can date anyone?

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:06,672
I don't know.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:09,541
I mean, obviously if someone
special comes along...

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:12,077
B-But I mean
<i>really</i> special, like,

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,513
nothing I've even remotely
considered in the past.

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,016
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit. I want that
kind of love like that docking kind of love.

8
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:20,252
Oh, yeah. Like, penis in the
foreskin kind of love...

9
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:23,889
Mm-hmm... just, like,
warm, just like...

10
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,657
He...

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,862
Everybody [bleep] off.

12
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,163
Morty, I need your help.

13
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,132
W-W-W-We... We need to go
on a quick adventure.

14
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:34,600
You said
I could go to school today.

15
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:36,602
That was before
I needed something, Morty.

16
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,771
There's a plasma shard
in the Abadango Cluster.

17
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:41,373
A princess has it.
If I get it, I'll be awesome.

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,076
We've been going non-stop, Rick.
It's not healthy.

19
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,577
You know,
these are my teenage years.

20
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,346
I-I just found out
Jessica's single.

21
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:50,549
Oh, that's... Wow, Morty. Wow.
What an exciting life you lead.

22
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,252
Let's go. In and out,
20 minutes adventure.

23
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,288
They're on our tail!

24
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,756
Steady, Morty.
Five cetons.

25
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,930
Steady, God damn it!
Two cetons.

26
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:06,665
Wha!

27
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:12,971
Fire!

28
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,909
Pull up, Morty, pull up!
Pull up!

29
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:45,504
[ Bleep ]

30
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,476
Oh, [Bleep]

31
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:51,643
[ Bleep ]

32
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,079
Ahh! Ahh!

33
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,281
I can't [bleep] do
this anymore!

34
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,750
That was seriously [bleep] up.
We almost died.

35
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:02,087
So you agree? [Bleep] yes!
That w... T-This was insane!

36
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,455
That was pure luck.

37
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,017
I was not in control
of that situation at all.

38
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,797
Look at this, Morty.
Look at my [bleep] hand.

39
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,033
Look at this shit. Why do
you keep doing this to us?!

40
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,502
I don't know, Morty.

41
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:18,070
Maybe I hate myself,
maybe I think I deserve to die.

42
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,432
I-I-I-I don't...
I don't know!

43
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,977
We need a vacation.

44
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,317
Isn't that something?
You were right...

45
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,818
Best day spa
in the galaxy.

46
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,287
It's not even cruel, either.

47
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:09,721
These things are just doing what
they do in the wild...

48
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:11,456
It loves swallowing
stressed-out creatures

49
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,158
for 20 minutes
and then puking them up.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,427
My whole body's
like a baby's ass.

51
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,596
Complimentary
psychological detox?

52
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,231
Removes
all your cognitive toxins,

53
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,599
purifies your system.

54
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,401
Oof, this guy on commission
or something?

55
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,236
I don't think...
Are you on commission?

56
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,837
We're not on commission.

57
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:26,939
We get paid by the hour.

58
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,073
There's no incentive
really...

59
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,141
Oh, my God.
Okay, listen...

60
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,442
W-W-W-We'll try
the machine,

61
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,977
but... but I'd like you
to try something.

62
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,713
Try swallowing
the giant ball of snot

63
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,548
that's dangling around
in the back of your throat.

64
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,983
It's disgusting.

65
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:39,284
Nobody wants to hear that.

66
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,088
That's what you do. Okay,
Rick, come on. Enough.

67
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,123
Man, did you hear me bite
that guy's head off?

68
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,692
Geez, I really need
to chill.

69
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,927
Maybe you should go through
twice.

70
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:52,164
All right, mister comedy man, you don't have
to bust my balls. You're not helping things.

71
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:56,068
Rick, is this thing
supposed to be making this...

72
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:06,011
Morty!

73
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,512
- Ri-Rick...
- Morty!

74
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,181
What happened?

75
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,650
We blew up, idiot!
Are you really that stupid?

76
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,752
Obviously the guy I yelled at
overloaded the machine.

77
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,194
It takes more than that to kill
Rick and Morty, mother[bleep]!

78
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,492
But this might do it.

79
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,394
Run, Morty!
E-Everything hurts!

80
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,329
That's because
you're worthless!

81
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,965
Jesus,
how big was this explosion?

82
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,567
I'm a genius. I don't have time
for this [bleep].

83
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,636
W-W-We're in Hell,
aren't we, Rick?

84
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,738
- You're so stupid, Morty.
- You're an idiot.

85
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,606
There's no such thing as Hell.

86
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,742
I believe you,
but I just want to die.

87
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,678
You can die when I say so.
I control you.

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,381
I control the universe!
Why am I bragging about that?

89
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,749
I have nothing to prove.

90
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,851
I'm surrounded by inferior
pieces of [bleep] and...

91
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,954
Toxins.

92
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,757
We're not in Hell, Morty.
We're in the detoxifier.

93
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,925
The machine didn't blow up.
It worked normally.

94
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,260
It removed our toxins.

95
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,762
<i>We're</i> the toxins.

96
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:57,796
Are you listening,

97
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,264
you stupid little
garbage person?!

98
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,466
We're what got removed!!

99
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,338
I hope you both found that detox
sufficiently relaxing.

100
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,774
Hey, man, listen... Those comments
I made about your throat?

101
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,242
It's all good.

102
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,044
It's nice of you
to let me off the hook.

103
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,680
It's still unacceptable
behavior, and I do regret it.

104
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,648
Believe me, man, I've been
working here a long time.

105
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,730
I get it.

106
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,155
Hey, uh, you mind
if I put on some music?

107
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,656
Not at all.

108
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,859
♪ Grab my terrifolds ♪

109
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,228
What is that?
I just hit shuffle.

110
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,763
Are you kidding?

111
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,899
- This universe.
- Oh, excuse me.

112
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,867
We should listen to one random
song a day, you know?

113
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,703
We'd end up hearing
more songs we didn't like,

114
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,404
but we'd discover
a lot more that we did.

115
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,739
That is
an interesting concept.

116
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,207
You know,
it makes me wonder

117
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,675
if there's
an algorithmic expression

118
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,243
that could achieve
the ideal ratio.

119
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,545
Listen to me...

120
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,381
Trying to calculate
happiness over here.

121
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,882
Hoo, if anyone could,
Rick.

122
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,818
Hey, here's something
no science could measure...

123
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,220
I'm real proud
to be your grandpa, Morty.

124
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,189
Thanks, Rick.
I love you.

125
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,691
Yeah, mother[bleep]!
Yeah! Get it! Get some!

126
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,860
Right up your [bleep] bitch ass,
you [bleep]!

127
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,795
Guess who just discovered
a new element?!

128
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,530
You think you could do that,
Morty?

129
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,367
You think anyone but me could do
that ever in a billion years?

130
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,402
Do you think if God existed
he could do it?

131
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:11,570
The answer is no.

132
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,405
If God exists,
it's [bleep] me.

133
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,307
Yes, Rick.
I-I agree, Rick.

134
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,110
While you were flapping
your parasitic turd holster,

135
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,846
I discovered the toxic equivalent
of electricity, Morty.

136
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,414
What do you think
about that?

137
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,416
Uh... I th... I think my voice
is annoying.

138
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,218
It is,
<i>and</i> it's your best quality.

139
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,619
So true.

140
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,422
Now, who can tell me
the common denominator

141
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,790
of these two factions?

142
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,892
You don't know
or y'all just bored?

143
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,161
Hey, listen, you know, wha...
If we're all bored over here,

144
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,463
wouldn't the common
denominator be you?

145
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,899
Damn, Morty.
That's hilarious.

146
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,335
Normally I would come down
on any kind of disruption,

147
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:44,936
but it seems to represent
a positive change

148
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,971
for your character.

149
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,773
Class dismissed!

150
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,541
- Awesome, Morty!
- You done good, Morty.

151
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,876
Oh, yeah!

152
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,477
Thanks for the advice, Morty.
You got it.

153
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,179
I did it, Morty!
I knew you could.

154
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,414
Hey, Morty,
remember yesterday

155
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,982
when I couldn't
play the trombone?

156
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,417
Well, check this out!

157
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,586
Just like I told you,
Mitch...

158
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,121
The music was in your heart
the whole time.

159
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:07,058
Stupid hat... Wish I had
the courage to just be myself.

160
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,860
There you are.

161
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,764
You might have
all these idiots fooled,

162
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,400
but I know you're still
the same pathetic loser

163
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,335
hiding behind
a confident facade.

164
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,004
I know that because...

165
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,473
I'm doing the same thing,
brother.

166
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,275
I'm not alone anymore!

167
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:27,412
Hey, Morty. Word around school
is you've become super healthy.

168
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,880
I don't know
about all that.

169
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,849
I do, however, know that I have
a pretty bad case of

170
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,218
haven't taken you
to dinner-itis.

171
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,586
Might be fatal.

172
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,521
Hey, kids.
Uh, hope I'm not interrupting.

173
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,156
Morty,
a moment of your time?

174
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,357
Happy to help, Rick.

175
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,826
I hate to bug you
with this,

176
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,861
but after our morning hike
I started receiving very faint,

177
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,530
highly unusual transmissions
on my sub ether phone.

178
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,598
Listen.

179
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,704
It's a bad phone.
Chuck it.

180
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,806
I downgraded to a clamshell
for emergencies only.

181
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,475
You know, if... if... if
something's worth saying,

182
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,709
I-it's worth eye contact.

183
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,678
Uh, I-I-I traced
the source of the call

184
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,480
back to the spa
we went to, Morty.

185
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,981
I thought I could hear
a voice in there,

186
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,051
so I enhanced it,
a-and listen.

187
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,086
Hey, asshole!
Oh, man!

188
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,955
Remember us?
Oh, I don't like confrontation!

189
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,823
You [bleep] us,
you pieces of garbage!

190
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,226
That's right,
you're [bleep] garbage, not us.

191
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:15,560
I'm a [bleep] genius
and a god.

192
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,095
You really think
this thing can hold me?

193
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,030
I'm gonna rip
your throat...

194
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,600
Morty, what if the toxic parts
of us have their own identities,

195
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:22,934
their own will to live?

196
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:24,636
W-What if mine shares
my intelligence

197
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,538
and devised a way
to reach out to us?

198
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,739
Sounds like
he's in a lot of pain.

199
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,908
Lot. O. Pain.

200
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,877
But, you know, you shouldn't
have to deal with that, man.

201
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,378
You know,
l-let's work off your trauma

202
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,513
with some urban spin yoga.

203
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,181
It's amazing.
You do yoga on a bike,

204
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,616
but you have
an at-risk preteen...

205
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,484
I don't think I can
just blow this off, Morty.

206
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:42,354
If I had known it worked this
way, I wouldn't have detoxed.

207
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,222
Well, I would have
because I was toxic.

208
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:47,492
Now I'm detoxed and I'm
accountable to my toxins, right?

209
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,495
I-It's a dilemma.
I think I know what to do.

210
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,297
Morty!
Rick!

211
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,833
You know, the only problem here
is a big fat brain

212
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,002
that misses eating
all them big fat problems.

213
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,871
Focus on the good thing.
Trust me, things are good.

214
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,773
Taking that away from me...

215
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,542
...that wouldn't be
healthy.

216
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,447
Oh, man. World's Greatest
Grandpa, for reals.

217
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,182
It's not just a coffee cup
for you, bud.

218
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,617
You're legit.

219
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,024
I love drums.
I never took drum lessons.

220
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,993
Why? Limitations. We are
addicted to our own limitations.

221
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:22,994
How amazing is that?

222
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,396
Is the kale prepared
in the kitchen?

223
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,830
I'll have a water.
Uh...

224
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,500
How is the...
"cru-dite?"

225
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,835
Crudité.
It's a cup of carrot sticks.

226
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,871
Ha! It's okay!
Pronounce it however you want.

227
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,806
Words are just things.
Please. Thank you.

228
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,207
We're having
a conversation.

229
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,376
God, I am so excited
to finally have dinner with you.

230
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,278
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

231
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,479
It's like, whew!

232
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,081
I-I-I wish you'd shut up,
though.

233
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,050
Just kidding. You know,
you're so quiet. What's wrong?

234
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,651
W-Why don't you tell me
about yourself?

235
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,153
What's the atmosphere like
on planet Jessica?

236
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,655
Where's the equator,
what are the vacations,

237
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,157
a-and the holidays?

238
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,259
I mean, you know,
are they the same time?

239
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,928
Talk to me. Well... I...
like this restaurant.

240
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,198
Holy [bleep]! Holy [bleep]!
We have a moron over here!

241
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,566
I'm an idiot.

242
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,867
I can't believe I haven't
thought of this.

243
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,669
You have to do
this detox thing I did.

244
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,471
It's an alien spa,
you go through it,

245
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,539
fwoos-s-s-ssh,

246
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,608
lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa...

247
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,043
...sucks everything out.

248
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,845
Everything that was holding me
back, everything bad,

249
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,413
I mean, it just...

250
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,948
Right?

251
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,917
Cooooool.

252
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,186
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this.

253
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,121
Yeah, phones are awful,
I downgraded to...

254
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,823
I totally forgot my...

255
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,226
I have a... thing, and...

256
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,829
Things are good. You know what?
Why am I doing that?

257
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,230
That's more rude
than the truth.

258
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,532
Look, I'm sorry, Morty.
I just don't think...

259
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,936
Do not. Even.
You have no need to explain.

260
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,271
It's all good. I think
you'd get bored with me.

261
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:42,507
E-Exactly.
Look, the sparks aren't flying.

262
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,109
This is what dating is for,
you know?

263
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,077
First date, no sparks.

264
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,546
No damage, no worries.
Life is a highway.

265
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,281
We're gonna ride it
all night lonnngg!

266
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,183
Gonna eat some "crudite."
Mmm!

267
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,953
Is this organic? Mmm.
All right.

268
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,721
You know, the
evening continues.

269
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,857
Okay, here we go.

270
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,192
Ma'am, I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

271
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,894
Your money's no good here.

272
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,396
I'll... I'll get the next round,
sir.

273
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,032
Aren't you a child? Only
in the ways that matter.

274
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,134
Morty.
Stacy.

275
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,669
I've been watching you drink,
Stacy.

276
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,070
I get the feeling
you've got a hard job.

277
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,938
I wonder what it takes
to please you.

278
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,074
That's the job I want...
Part time, full time,

279
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,909
I want to be good at it,
bad at it,

280
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,879
I want to get promoted, fired,
corner office, hostile takeover,

281
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,181
workplace accident...
I'm on my knees, Stacy...

282
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,017
Praying, worshipping, begging,
whatever you want.

283
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,487
What do you think about that?

284
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,755
Okay. [Bleep] it.

285
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,057
Tink.

286
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,126
Mm!

287
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,362
Let's ask my grandpa.
He's a scientist.

288
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,565
Hey, Rick, are you familiar
with "Ben Wa" technology?

289
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,866
Morty, great news.

290
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,101
I went back to the spa
and they let me purchase

291
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,836
the containment unit
from their detoxifier.

292
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,871
Why? Because we're
coming home, bitch!

293
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,008
What is this? This is the parts of
your pussy grandpa that keep it real.

294
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,243
Oh... oh, and I think you
dropped something, too!

295
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,378
I don't want to be
on camera.

296
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,813
I'm ugly and gross,
please.

297
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,715
Should I go? You're
your own person, Stacy.

298
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:57,716
Then I'd like to stay.

299
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,250
Rick, please tell me

300
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,119
you're not trying to put
that stuff back inside of us.

301
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,588
Morty, I'm sorry. That stuff
is alive and it belongs with us.

302
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,957
We yanked them from their homes
and locked them in a can.

303
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,492
Mother[bleep]!

304
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,893
See?
They're living in pain.

305
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,762
That's what they do, Rick,
they live in pain.

306
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,430
They<i> are</i> pain, you know?

307
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,165
They... they're all the bad
parts of us, which, by the way,

308
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,633
includes our dishonesty,

309
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:17,535
so how do you know this isn't
all some sort of crazy trick?

310
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:20,505
Oh, so now because I'm made
entirely of toxins I'm also a liar?

311
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,140
[Bleep] you,
you little sociopath.

312
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,309
You hear this, Morty? Oh,
everybody hates me. I can tell.

313
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,910
Y-You all hate me... All
right, shut up, Morty.

314
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,479
Healthy Rick,
are we doing this or what?

315
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,180
Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you
to step into the booth.

316
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,349
Don't negotiate
with that little turd, dummy.

317
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:32,984
You're the Rick.
You need to show dominance.

318
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,521
Morty, booth, now. Booth!

319
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,089
Come on, Morty.
Don't touch me!

320
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,558
Morty, do the healthy thing and
voluntarily retoxify yourself.

321
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,860
Nooooo!

322
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,328
Is it wrong if I think
this is kind of hot?

323
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,363
Let me out of here!
Stacy, help! Open the door!

324
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,198
I need to hear our safe word,
Morty.

325
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,067
Sea Cucumber!
Sea Cucumber!

326
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,236
What are you doing? I'll do
anything for you, Morty.

327
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,837
No!

328
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,876
It worked! Yes!
That idiot believed every word.

329
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,011
Now let's see how<i> he</i> enjoys
living in that shit tank.

330
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,780
He's right behind me,
isn't he?

331
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,662
He's in<i> front</i> of you. Oh. My
eyes are still adjusting.

332
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,651
Uh, is this like
a sex dungeon?

333
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,853
I guess I should've been
paying attention.

334
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,790
After 70 years
of being bottled up

335
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,191
inside a
sentimental jackass,

336
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,026
I finally get to live
my own life.

337
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,996
You said we were merging. I lied,
dumbass! I lie about everything!

338
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,331
Why would I ever re-merge
with a pussy like you?

339
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,200
So... you were just gonna trap us
in that tank?

340
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,503
T-That was your plan? Not<i> was,</i>
mother[bleep]... still is.

341
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,071
...Kill him, Rick!

342
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,439
I don't like this!
This is scary!

343
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,541
All right,
you asked for it.

344
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,176
Did I ask for this?

345
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,745
Did I ask for this?
Huh? Did I?

346
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:35,814
<i>Assessing threat to groin.</i>

347
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,082
Groin System 6000.
Kill him!

348
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,985
<i>That... is my groin's user.</i>

349
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,520
Believe me, I got a lot more use
out of that thing

350
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:43,788
than he ever did.

351
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,357
<i>You know what?
Not my table.</i>

352
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:54,199
<i>You</i> do<i> know me.</i>

353
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,500
What the hell,
Grandpa Rick?

354
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,462
[Bleep] you, Summer!
Sorry, Summer!

355
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,338
Okay, okay, take it easy.
Don't do it.

356
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,574
I love you. Good boy.

357
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,708
Daddy's little boy.

358
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,109
Summer,
get out of here! Go!

359
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,177
Oh, who's that?

360
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,712
Who's
that over there?

361
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,448
Oh, no. You see the bad man
in front of you?

362
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,749
You're a good little boy,
you're gonna get him.

363
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,618
You're gonna get him.

364
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,287
Ahh!

365
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,223
Son of a...

366
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,297
Ahh!

367
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,868
Nice try, asshole.

368
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,569
We can resolve
our issues.

369
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:33,438
We don't need to resort
to over-the-top...

370
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,307
Aah!

371
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,042
I-I did it, Rick.
I got the tank!

372
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,911
I-I'm a piece of [bleep],
but I got the tank!

373
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,713
You're going in that tank,
mother[bleep].

374
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,381
You're gonna live in
that toxic [bleep] wasteland

375
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,415
like I had to do!

376
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,177
Ahh!
Ow!

377
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,709
That's right, mother...
You're going in that [bleep]...

378
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,559
Dads?

379
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,094
Okay, just...
Just leave her out of it.

380
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,395
What's going on?

381
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,897
All right, [bleep] this.
Time for plan B...

382
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,565
If I can't trap you
in a toxic world,

383
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,836
I'll just make the whole world
toxic.

384
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,204
It's okay, girls.

385
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,439
I-I'm so sorry I put us in
danger with some of my behavior.

386
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,875
I-If you'd like I can go out
in the g-garden,

387
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,511
pick some fresh basil,
and make us a nice Scallopini.

388
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,280
What did the booger version
of you mean

389
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,982
when he said he was going
to make the whole world toxic?

390
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,052
Believe me, sweetie, that man's
motivations are a mystery.

391
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,987
Screw that, Rick.
We got to stop him.

392
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:25,456
What's the last thing you'd think
about doing with that tank thing?

393
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,425
Morty, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

394
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,027
but it's not our place,
you know,

395
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,362
to pick and choose which world
gets saved from what apocalypse.

396
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:34,299
Our... our toxins have as much
a right to their worldview as...

397
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,567
Morty, how is it healthy
to slap me?

398
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,835
Obviously my
version of health

399
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,570
is a hell of a lot different
from yours,

400
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,805
you useless old turd.

401
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,106
Wait. That's it.

402
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,908
How could that detox machine
know the difference

403
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,011
between healthy and sick for
everything that goes through it?

404
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,446
It can't.

405
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,348
It must be by the individual's
own definition of toxicity.

406
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,983
That means...

407
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,952
Dad! What the...
What the hell, Rick?

408
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:54,953
I'll explain on the way.

409
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,554
This "Moon Tower," Morty,

410
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,690
is the perfect height
and metallic composition

411
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,858
for the amplification
and beaming of toxic energies.

412
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,226
What do you think about that,
Morty?

413
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,728
Are you excited about that,
Morty?

414
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,597
Oh, man. I'm just freaked out.
I-It's too high up here.

415
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:08,066
Once I flip this switch,

416
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,501
the entire world is gonna
be just as toxic as us, baby.

417
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,410
As we praise
our loving Father...

418
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,413
God is a lie!
We made him up for money!

419
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,887
Santa Claus isn't real.

420
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,690
You were all mistakes!

421
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,426
We [bleep] did it, Morty.

422
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,794
Put your [bleep] hands
in the air.

423
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,396
Yeah, you little piece
of [bleep].

424
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,264
Remember me?

425
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,934
Didn't you learn last time
that you can't beat me?

426
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:44,869
Yeah, I did. And then I learned
something else.

427
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,571
- This.
- Ahh!!

428
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,007
That bullet is laced with an
encrypted nanobotic virus

429
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,743
that will disintegrate your
Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.

430
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:52,944
You think I give a [bleep]?

431
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:54,545
I know you give a [bleep],
dummy.

432
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,646
Because I know I don't.

433
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,015
Here's another thing
I know...

434
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,783
The decryption key
that neutralizes the virus.

435
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,151
You want it?
Come and get it.

436
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,919
Merge with me and you'll know
how to save him.

437
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,621
Pfft. Come on, man.
I've been trapped

438
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,356
in your pussy brain
for 70 years of delusions,

439
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,359
but this is the all-time weakest
bluff that I've ever...

440
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,294
Ow-Ohh!! Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?!

441
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,196
He's cutting your time in half.
10 minutes. Ohh! It hurts!

442
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,731
What is your problem?

443
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,567
Oh, I had all my problems
removed... my entitlement,

444
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,569
my narcissism,
my crippling loneliness,

445
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,071
my irrational attachments.

446
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,173
They must be somewhere.
They ain't over here, bro.

447
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,574
I'm not going back in there!

448
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,176
Honestly,
I don't care either way.

449
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:26,611
I hate having you in me.

450
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,945
And when I say "honestly"
you can believe it,

451
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,714
because we both know
I'm too healthy to lie.

452
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,215
Watch.

453
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,184
All right! Knock it off!
You're not impressing anyone.

454
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,253
Morty, not that I give
a [bleep], but are you okay?

455
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,255
Jesus Christ, it hurts.
Relax, quit your bitching.

456
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,490
Y-You're gonna be fine.
Grandpa's here.

457
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,025
You think that's funny?

458
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:43,094
Y-You got to have a sense
of humor about these things.

459
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:44,495
Oh, wait, you can't.

460
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,531
You're literally incapable
of seeing the bigger picture.

461
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,132
I guess it's just funny
because you've never done

462
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,901
anything but complain
about me being in charge,

463
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,637
but if I ever gave you the wheel
we'd be dead in five minutes.

464
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,339
- Rick?
- You poor, dumb, sick animal.

465
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:56,407
Rick?

466
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,609
Ahh! Just do it!

467
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,511
Just do it, you piece of...

468
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,349
I'm back, baby! Regular Rick!
Master of both worlds!

469
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,651
Check it it out!

470
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,186
"Excuse me."

471
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,788
Now we'll just reverse
this hacky toxicity beam.

472
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,990
Man, I really over think shit
when I'm angry.

473
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,962
Oh, give it to me.

474
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,331
Mm, ma-mah.

475
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,201
God is<i> not</i> a lie.

476
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,411
Mommy! Mommy!

477
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,645
Ha! All right, Morty,

478
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,481
now it's time we re-merge
your little ass.

479
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,815
You're a better man
than me, Rick.

480
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,083
I'm healthy
enough to admit that!

481
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,786
That kid is a
real piece of [bleep].

482
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,887
Y-Y-You're gonna save me,
right?

483
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,056
Part of me wanted to,
Toxic Morty.

484
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:48,392
Part of me
really wanted to.

485
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,496
I'm telling you,
these shares are hot. Yeah.

486
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:53,798
That sounds like a good idea.
It's definitely a good idea.

487
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,334
Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it,
now can you get me?

488
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,835
Have I ever lied to you?

489
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:01,239
That's right, and ask around,
I never do, Duane.

490
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,640
Let me put this real simple.

491
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,009
This stock is a beautiful
redhead, recently single,

492
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,311
not looking to date
but ready to fall in love,

493
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,381
and fate has put her locker
two down from yours, Duane...

494
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,116
Two lockers down.

495
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:14,152
So step up or
step off, Duane.

496
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,954
Blue pill or red pill,
what'll be, bro?

497
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,625
Totally understand, Duane.

498
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,293
You're the boss.

499
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,728
Heinholz Biotech...

500
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,696
Million and a half
at thirty-three.

501
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,598
Heh.

502
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,700
You little [bleep] monster.

503
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,273
Mmm! Is this organic?

504
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,807
Mmm!

505
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,443
Go for Morty.

506
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,279
Hi, Morty. It's Jessica.

507
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:43,447
Look, can we just talk
for a minute?

508
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,883
Is that how long it takes
for Rick to trace my location?

509
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,219
Come back, Morty.
I miss you.

510
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,287
You miss the old me.

511
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,621
You miss someone
that loved you so much

512
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:51,923
you never
had to love 'em back.

513
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,558
How do you know
I don't want to love you?

514
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,860
Because I'm not sick.
Ex-girlfriend?

515
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,429
Should I be jealous? There's
nothing to be jealous of.

516
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,798
I just realized that I'm scheduled
to speak at that fundraiser

517
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,366
on our date night.

518
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,503
I can cancel. We'll be together.
That's a date.

519
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,205
You are the perfect man.

520
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,874
Oh, sweetie, I think you hit
the wrong button.

521
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,175
You didn't hang up.

522
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,377
Huh. How 'bout that?

523
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,884
Sorry, tiny American Psycho,

524
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,086
time to take the opposite
of your medicine.

525
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,089
Do what you got to do.

526
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,992
Oh! Ow! Ahh!

527
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:29,927
So, how do you feel,
Morty?

528
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,530
Ah, geez. I'm miserable.
Am I good or what?

529
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,865
I guess it's worth it, though,
to know how much you care.

530
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,602
Care? Me?
Morty, I'm fine with you.

531
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,370
I only did this for him.
You lying bitch.

532
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,039
She kept coming to our house,
Morty, and kept asking me.

533
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,208
"Did... did... d-did you get
a new Morty yet?"

534
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,277
Because you kept drunk dialing
me and crying about it.

535
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,478
I wasn't crying!

536
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,813
Jacquelyn, I...

537
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,514
I-I-I wasn't
who I said I was.

538
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,984
You weren't a 14-year-old boy
from the Midwest

539
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,186
who ran away from his family
and capitalized

540
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,888
on his lack of conscience
by becoming a stock broker?

541
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,091
Oh. I guess I was pretty
up front about that, wasn't I?

542
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,859
You were up front
about everything.

543
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,060
You were my soul mate.

544
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:06,864
Well...
N... Not anymore. I'll, um...

545
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,266
Y-You can keep the apartment,

546
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,368
and... and... and,
uh... the drones.

547
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,636
She can't keep the drones.

548
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,870
They turn into
a little Voltron robot.

549
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:13,971
They're awesome.

550
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,275
You can't keep the drones.

551
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:20,344
So, how was your date
with Brad?

552
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,413
It wasn't a date.
We were just having lunch.

553
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,215
You guys are getting
back together, aren't you?

554
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,650
Morty, I need your help
on an adventure.

555
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,051
Eh, "need"
is a strong word.

556
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,153
We need door stops,
but a brick would work, too.

557
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:31,322
Okay.

558
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,624
Morty.

559
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,293
Good to have you back.

560
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,262
Have you ever been peed on
before?

561
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:41,132
Oh, my God. Yum.

00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,171
they were popular
in the late 19th century.

580
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,640
An entire town could be
illuminated by...

What the hell is this?

582

Sea Cucumber!

1
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:36,099
T-T-T-This is just
sloppy craftsmanship.

2
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:37,517
Hey, Rick.

3
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,770
Boy, sure is really especially
beautiful out there today, huh?

4
00:00:40,854 --> 00:00:42,063
Oh, yes, Morty.

5
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:43,940
I-it's almost unbelievable,
isn't it?

6
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,066
Yeah, you know?

7
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,317
There's something about the air

8
00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:48,027
and just the way the sunshine is.

9
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:49,028
Uh, sure, buddy. Yeah.

10
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:50,780
Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.

11
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:51,781
Wha... convincing?

12
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:52,949
Oh. Responsive, too.

13
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:54,325
In real time. I love it.

14
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,994
Uhh...okay.

15
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:57,245
I'm going to work.

16
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,663
Morty, good morning.

17
00:00:58,747 --> 00:00:59,789
Dad, good morning.

18
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:01,749
I am going to work. Goodbye.

19
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,251
What's with mom?

20
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:04,752
Oh, what's with mom?

21
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:06,671
So, you're saying that
she's acting weird?

22
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:08,256
How sophisticated.

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,549
Careful, guys.

24
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,426
You're gonna burn out
the CPU with this one.

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,719
Okay, you know what, Rick?

26
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:13,886
You're acting weird, too.

27
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:16,723
Whatever,
quote-unquote "Morty."

28
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:17,974
All right, well...

29
00:01:18,058 --> 00:01:19,309
I'll see you after school.

30
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:21,144
Ow! Oof! Ugh!

31
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:22,228
Damn it!

32
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:23,479
I'm all right. I'm okay.

33
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:28,985
All right, who can tell
me what 5 x 9 is?

34
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:31,613
Morty?

35
00:01:31,697 --> 00:01:32,572
Uh, me?

36
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:33,823
What is 5 x 9?

37
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:36,993
Umm...you know,
it's uhh...at least 40.

38
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:40,455
Morty, that's exactly correct!

39
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:43,041
5 x 9 is at least 40!

40
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,000
Come up here.

41
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:45,418
Whoo! Way to go, Morty!

42
00:01:45,502 --> 00:01:47,879
Everybody,
this is the best student.

43
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:49,881
I want you to be
the teacher today.

44
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:51,341
Teach us, Morty!

45
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:52,592
Interesting.

46
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:54,052
W-w-w-what do you
want me to teach you?

47
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:55,178
Ooh, ooh!

48
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:57,013
How do you make
concentrated dark matter?

49
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:58,264
Oh, that's a good question.

50
00:01:58,349 --> 00:01:59,682
Concentrated huh?

51
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:00,892
Concentrated dark matter...

52
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:03,478
the fuel for accelerated
space travel.

53
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:04,562
Now, do you know
how to make it?

54
00:02:04,647 --> 00:02:05,521
Umm...

55
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:06,522
Come on, Morty.

56
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:08,775
Isn't your grandpa,
like, a scientist?

57
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:11,402
Oh, yeah, but, you know,
he told me that I shouldn't go

58
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:14,113
around spouting off about, you
know, his science and stuff.

59
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:17,200
I bet you've seen him make
concentrated dark matter a lot.

60
00:02:17,284 --> 00:02:20,453
You know, if you tell us,
I'll be your girlfriend.

61
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:21,621
Uh, y-you will?

62
00:02:21,705 --> 00:02:23,623
Seems like a rare opportunity,
Morty.

63
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:26,834
Morty, u-uh, come on.
There's a family emergency.

64
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,002
Stop right there!

65
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:29,212
If he leaves,
I'm giving him an "F."

66
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:30,254
He doesn't care.

67
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,297
Aw, man!

68
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:32,715
Rick, I have to go back!

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,175
I think I was about
to get married!

70
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,343
Ugh! Take a shower with me,
Morty.

71
00:02:35,427 --> 00:02:36,260
What?!

72
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:37,553
Listen to me, Morty.

73
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:39,430
Get your clothes off and
get in the shower right now.

74
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:41,224
Y-y-y-you got to
trust me, Morty.

75
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:42,266
Ugh!

76
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:43,643
I'm gonna get an
"F" in class, Rick.

77
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:44,852
Morty, that's not class.

78
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,396
T-T-T-That wasn't your teacher.

79
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,647
This isn't your school.

80
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:49,273
This entire world
is not the world.

81
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:51,734
We're inside a huge simulation
chamber on an alien spaceship.

82
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:52,735
Wait a minute.

83
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,986
W-what are you talking about?

84
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:55,905
It's all fake Morty...
all of it.

85
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,742
Nanobotic renderings, a bunch
of crazy fake nonsense, Morty.

86
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:01,577
I couldn't say so until
we got in the shower.

87
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:02,870
They won't monitor
us in here.

88
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:04,455
Monitor us?! W-who?!

89
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,957
Zigerion scammers, Morty...

90
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,127
the Galaxy's most ambitious,
least successful con artists.

91
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,379
You know, it's lucky for
us they're also really

92
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,422
uncomfortable with nudity.

93
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:13,673
Aw, come on, Rick.

94
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,007
If everyone's just
gonna be insane today,

95
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:17,135
at least let me be
insane with Jessica.

96
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:18,177
I can't let
you do that, Morty.

97
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:19,053
Give it to me!

98
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:19,929
No!

99
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:20,847
You give it to me!

100
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:22,765
G-g-give it! No, Rick!

101
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,234
Oh, God, Sir!
They're still naked!

102
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:34,777
Ugh.

103
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:37,113
Well, check every five Quintons
and tell me when they're not.

104
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,407
I think we should
make Kevin look, sir.

105
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,450
What?! No!

106
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:41,951
W-w-why would you even say that?

107
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:44,078
Uh, sir, we have
a situation over here.

108
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:45,705
If there's a wiener on that
monitor,

109
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:47,290
I swear to god, Stu...

110
00:03:47,374 --> 00:03:49,292
something is drawing a
lot of processing power.

111
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,543
Oh, wait. No wonder.

112
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:53,004
There's another real
human in the simulator.

113
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:55,339
Okay, Jerry...
big pitch meeting.

114
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:56,549
Make-or-break time.

115
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:58,551
You can do this.

116
00:03:58,635 --> 00:03:59,677
How did this ha ppen?!

117
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:01,179
Where's the
Abductions Department?

118
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:03,806
Hey, man, Abductions just
follows the acquisition order.

119
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:05,308
Don't put this
on Acquisitions!

120
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:07,935
We only acquire humans that
haven't been simulated!

121
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,730
Well, simulations doesn't
simulate anybody that's been

122
00:04:10,814 --> 00:04:12,940
abducted,
so oh, I see!

123
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:14,317
Oh, oh!
It was no one's fault.

124
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:15,568
Oh, okay.

125
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:16,819
I'm sorry.
Well, then, problem solved.

126
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:17,945
Oh, wait... no.

127
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,989
There's still another
human in here!

128
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:21,407
Who is he?

129
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:22,992
Rick's son-in-law,
Jerry Smith.

130
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,870
So far, he hasn't noticed
he's in a simulation.

131
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:28,498
Well, cap his sector at 5%
processing,

132
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,708
keep his settings on auto, and
we'll deal with him later.

133
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:32,919
Rick Sanchez is the target.

134
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:36,506
Got to relax.

135
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,882
It's just a pitch.

136
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:39,217
Got to relax.

137
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,553
This is Earth radio.

138
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:45,264
And now, here's...human music.

139
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,478
Hmm. Human music.

140
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:53,022
I like it.

141
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,036
Rick!

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,204
Uhp, uhp, uhp!

143
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:09,580
Morty, keep your hands
off your ding-dong!

144
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:11,082
It's the only way
we can speak freely.

145
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,375
Look around you, Morty.

146
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,502
Do you really think
this world is real?

147
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:17,171
You'd have to be an idiot not to
notice all the slop by details.

148
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:19,382
Look... that guy's putting
a bun between two hot dogs.

149
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:20,508
I don't know, Rick.

150
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,051
I mean, I've seen people
do that before.

151
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:23,386
Well, look at that old lady.

152
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,096
She's... she's walking
a cat on a leash.

153
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,098
Uh, Mrs. Spencer does
that all the time, Rick.

154
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:29,517
Look, I-I-I don't want to
hear about Mrs. S pencer, Morty!

155
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:30,685
She's an idiot!

156
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:31,644
All right, all right, there.

157
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:32,895
W-what about that, Morty?

158
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,730
Okay, okay, you got me on that one.

159
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:35,940
Oh, really, Morty?

160
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:37,483
Are you sure you haven't
seen that somewhere

161
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:38,442
in real life before?

162
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:39,777
No, no.
I haven't seen that.

163
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:41,821
I mean, why would a
pop tart want to live inside

164
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:43,239
a toaster, Rick?

165
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,700
I mean, that would be, like, the
scariest place for them to live.

166
00:05:45,784 --> 00:05:46,826
You know what I mean?

167
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,077
You're missing
the point, Morty.

168
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,079
Why would he drive a smaller
toaster with wheels?

169
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:52,665
I mean, does your car look like
a smaller version of your house?

170
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:53,791
No.

171
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:54,876
So, why are they doing this?

172
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,043
W-what do they want?

173
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:57,211
Well, that would be
obvious to you, Morty,

174
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:58,504
if you'd been paying attention.

175
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:03,009
We got the President of the
United States in here!

176
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:05,928
We need 10cc of concentrated
dark matter, stat, or he'll die!

177
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:07,972
Concentrated dark matter?

178
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,682
They were asking
about that in class.

179
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,434
Yeah, it's a special fuel I
invented to travel through

180
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:13,144
space faster than
anybody else.

181
00:06:13,228 --> 00:06:15,396
These Zigerions are always
trying to scam me out of my secrets,

182
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,024
but they made a big
mistake this time, Morty.

183
00:06:18,108 --> 00:06:19,901
They dragged you into this.

184
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:21,068
Now they're gonna pay!

185
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:22,695
What do you...
w-w-what are we gonna do?

186
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:24,697
We'll scam the scammers,
Morty.

187
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:27,491
And we're gonna take them for
everything they've got.

188
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:30,202
National Apple Farmers of America,

189
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:32,371
welcome to our Ad Agency.

190
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:34,373
I'm Jerry Smith.

191
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,417
All right.

192
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,877
I'll just...get to the pitch.

193
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:41,923
Um, simple question, gentlemen,
what are apples?

194
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,341
Excuse me.

195
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:45,134
Ahh.

196
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:49,221
What are apples?

197
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:51,891
Apples are food.

198
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:54,477
And...when do we need food?

199
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:56,437
When we're hungry.

200
00:06:57,606 --> 00:07:00,566
With that, I give
you your new slogan!

201
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:04,070
Well, say something!

202
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:05,154
Do you like it?

203
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,280
Yes.

204
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:07,281
You do?

205
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:08,407
Yes.

206
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:10,034
So...I sold it?

207
00:07:10,118 --> 00:07:12,036
I sold the idea?

208
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,079
Yes.

209
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:14,789
Oh, my god! Thank you!

210
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:16,749
Thank you.

211
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,750
You're welcome.

212
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,255
Hey!

213
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,715
I just sold my first pitch!

214
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,385
Slow down! Lookin' good.

215
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:28,552
My man!

216
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:32,473
Hello.

217
00:07:32,557 --> 00:07:34,767
Guess who just sold
the apples campaign.

218
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,477
Who just sold
the apples campaign?

219
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,937
Me!

220
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:40,648
I guess it wasn't a rip-off
of "Got milk? " after all.

221
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:42,525
Guess someonewas wrong.

222
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:43,693
Yes.

223
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:45,236
Well, all is forgiven,
because right now,

224
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,571
I've got an erection the size
of an East coast lighthouse,

225
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,740
and I'm coming home to share
it with my beautiful wife.

226
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:50,658
Okay.

227
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:51,534
Wait... really?

228
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:52,451
Yes.

229
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:54,286
Yes! See you in 10 minutes!

230
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,329
Hey!

231
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:56,956
I'm going to make
love to my wife!

232
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,374
Lookin' good.

233
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,250
Slow down!

234
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:00,209
My man!

235
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:03,004
Aw, geez, Rick.

236
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,755
I-I don't know if I
like this plan, you know?

237
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,675
I mean, crowds,
t-t-t-they have a tendency

238
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,718
to make me
really nervous.

239
00:08:08,802 --> 00:08:09,927
Morty, relax.

240
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,679
It's just a bunch
of 1s and Os out there.

241
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:12,972
You're gonna be fine.

242
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:14,223
Just follow my lead.

243
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:15,808
Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

244
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,146
Uh-oh, Morty.

245
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,315
This crowd looks too small for
one of ourfamous rap concerts.

246
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,234
I don't think we can
perform our new song,

247
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,528
"The Recipe for
Concentrated Dark Matter,"

248
00:08:27,612 --> 00:08:28,738
for a crowd this tiny.

249
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:30,322
You got that right, Rick.

250
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:35,453
Now that's more like it!

251
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,163
Morty, here we go.

252
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:40,124
Let me hear everybody
say "Hey-oh!" yeah!

253
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:42,918
All the ladies say, "Yeah!"

254
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:46,255
Everybody over 30,
do this with your hands!

255
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:48,924
Everybody with a red shirt,
jump up and down!

256
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:01,896
Mm. Mm. Mm.

257
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,439
Yeah, don't move.

258
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,733
Mm, mm, mm, mm!

259
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:07,109
Mm!

260
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:09,904
Yo, everyone whose first name
begins with an "L"

261
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,615
who isn't Hispanic, walk in a
circle the same number of times

262
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:15,326
as the square root
of your age times 10!

263
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:19,455
Run, Morty!

264
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:20,748
Before the system reboots!

265
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,292
Yeah! You like that?

266
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,377
Now who's unremarkable?

267
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:26,921
You hungry for apples?

268
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,633
Are you hungry...for...apples?!

269
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,264
Oh, my God.

270
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:40,184
That's the best sex
I've ever had in my life.

271
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:44,480
It's...it's...too good.

272
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,774
I don't deserve this, Beth.

273
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:48,943
I'm a fraud.

274
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:49,985
Oh, man, Rick!

275
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,320
W-w-w-where we running to?

276
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:52,655
Out of the simulation,
Morty.

277
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,657
Normally, the chamber
operates like a treadmill,

278
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:56,492
with the virtual world
disappearing behind us

279
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,536
and being rendered in front
of us as we move through it,

280
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,580
but while it's frozen, Morty,
we can get to...

281
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:03,290
the edge.

282
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,333
Here we go.

283
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,292
Holy crap!

284
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:06,335
Come on, Morty.

285
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:10,047
Sir, they're over the edge.

286
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:11,215
Yes, they are.

287
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:14,218
Just...as...planned.

288
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,099
Oh, this is going to
be such a mindfuck!

289
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,478
Keep your eyes peeled for the
central processing room, Morty.

290
00:10:24,563 --> 00:10:26,230
That's how we're gonna
scam these idiots.

291
00:10:26,314 --> 00:10:28,649
So, hey, why do these aliens
keep coming after you, Rick,

292
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,109
if you're so
much smarter than them?

293
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:31,777
It's an obsession
for them at this point.

294
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:33,696
The Zigerions have
been trying to outsmart

295
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,989
me for years, Morty.

296
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:37,074
Every time they do,
I'm one step ahead of them.

297
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,200
Aha!

298
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,368
Here we go.

299
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:42,580
Grab as many processors
as you can carry, Morty.

300
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:44,039
These guys aren't good at much,

301
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:46,333
but they're really good
at making these chips.

302
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,253
I've got so many,
I can barely hold them all.

303
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:51,338
Look at...
look at this.

304
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:52,381
Oops. I dropped one.

305
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:53,799
Don't worry about it, Morty.

306
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,301
There's plenty of them,
you little goofball.

307
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:58,053
Come here, Morty!
Oh, I gotcha!

308
00:10:58,138 --> 00:10:59,013
Come on, quit it, Rick!

309
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:00,389
Quit it!

310
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:02,391
Nothing wrong with just a
little bit of horseplay every

311
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,018
now and then, little fella.

312
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,989
Wow. What do you know?

313
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:18,407
Huh. That was easy.

314
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,910
Totes malotes, dawg.

315
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,119
Just kind of hard to believe,
you know?

316
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:23,579
Believe it, Morty.

317
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,873
And once again, I'm flying away
with everything I can carry,

318
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:28,375
and the Zigerions
got nothing of mine.

319
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:35,841
Mr. Marklevitz,
do you have a...

320
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,051
minute to talk?

321
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:38,510
Yes.

322
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,179
Look, I'm a fraud.

323
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:41,722
I mean, let's face it...

324
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:44,225
"Hungry For Apples" is just
a rip-off of "Got Milk?"

325
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,517
It's almost identical.

326
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:46,810
Yes.

327
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:48,103
Okay.

328
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,355
I deserve that.

329
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,733
Umm...I guess...
I'll just pack up my desk.

330
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,026
Yes.

331
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:59,448
Oh, my God.

332
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:02,076
Wait. You know what?! No!

333
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,161
The milk people don't
have a patent on

334
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:06,121
simple rhetorical questions!

335
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,666
There's not even a single word
in "Hungry For Apples" that's

336
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,542
shared by "Got Milk?"

337
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:12,461
It's a completely
different slogan.

338
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:13,837
It's different!

339
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,839
And I shouldn't be fired.

340
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,549
I should be promoted!

341
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:18,801
- Yes.
- Yeah!

342
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:19,843
Wait. Really?

343
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:20,970
- Yes.
- Yes!

344
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:22,596
I mean, I'm...
it may be derivative,

345
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:24,473
but it's the most successful
campaign to come out of this

346
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:25,474
agency in a long time.

347
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:26,976
Yes.

348
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,978
I-I'm not saying it should win
an award for commercials,

349
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,063
but it could certainly be
nominatedfor an award

350
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:33,023
for commercials specifically
about apples,

351
00:12:33,108 --> 00:12:34,733
like...an Appley or something.

352
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:35,818
Yes.

353
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:36,944
Is there really an
award called the Appley

354
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:38,153
for Apple-Related ad campaigns?

355
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:39,280
Yes.

356
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:40,572
- Could we nominate me?
- Yes.

357
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:42,408
Holy crap!

358
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,707
Get in, Morty.

359
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,376
I'm gonna be able to use
these processors to make some

360
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,169
real important science stuff.

361
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:57,923
Huh.

362
00:12:58,008 --> 00:12:59,174
I thought I entered
the code right.

363
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:08,976
Wha... well, what's this?

364
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,520
W-what could this possibly be?

365
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:14,189
Because it looks like
you're inside a simulation...

366
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:17,109
inside a simulation.

367
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:18,736
You're still on the ship.

368
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,362
Game-day bucket go boom.

369
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:22,948
Sir, the, uh, doctor's
appointment to examine the

370
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,117
discoloration on your
butthole flaps was...

371
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,535
Too loud, Cynthia.

372
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,786
Too loud and too specific.

373
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:28,787
Uhh...

374
00:13:30,081 --> 00:13:31,874
We've known how to make
concentrated dark matter

375
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,917
for a long time.

376
00:13:34,002 --> 00:13:39,423
But now we also know the code to
your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez!

377
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:43,010
All your most valuable
secrets will now be ours!

378
00:13:43,094 --> 00:13:44,762
Uh, yeah, until I get home
before you and change the

379
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:46,347
combination,
you bunch of idiots!

380
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:47,765
That is why you're
never getting home.

381
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:48,974
Get them!

382
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:55,439
Run, Morty!

383
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:04,490
Oh, my God!

384
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:22,007
Ow!

385
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:32,267
I got to tell you,
this morning,

386
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:33,811
I didn't even know
this award existed.

387
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,354
Now I'm holdingone.

388
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:37,731
And...um...

389
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:41,568
look, I want to say that today
was the best day of my life...

390
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:45,781
but...the truth is, it's...
it's more meaningful than that.

391
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:46,824
My man!

392
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:48,158
Yes. Thank you, sir.

393
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,705
I...am...finally complete!

394
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:59,211
My... my... my... my man!

395
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,632
Aah!

396
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:04,967
What the hell?!

397
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:09,471
No.

398
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:10,472
- Jerry?!
- Dad!

399
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,015
What are you doing here?

400
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,183
W-why are you
dressed like a waiter?

401
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:14,393
Screw it.
We don't have time.

402
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,269
Come on.

403
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:16,770
No!

404
00:15:25,321 --> 00:15:26,238
Ohhhhh!

405
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:29,575
Aah!

406
00:15:49,137 --> 00:15:51,513
Yes! Yes! Yes!

407
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:00,606
Oof!

408
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:03,275
Man up, Jerry!

409
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,735
I may need you to
work the lasers.

410
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:19,249
Oh, man!
They're hot on our tail, Rick!

411
00:16:19,334 --> 00:16:21,293
I guess they really do have
concentrated dark matter.

412
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:22,878
Well, you know how to make it,
too, right, Rick?

413
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:23,962
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:25,339
Uh, check the engine room.

415
00:16:25,423 --> 00:16:28,091
We just need Cesium, Plutonic
Quarks, and bottled water.

416
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:31,595
It's all here, Rick!

417
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,679
Wow, Morty.
Lucky break.

418
00:16:32,764 --> 00:16:33,931
Grab that bucket.

419
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:37,184
Okay, two parts Plutonic Quarks,
one part Cesium.

420
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:38,393
Okay. Uh-huh.

421
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,897
All right.

422
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:43,482
Now empty the water bottle
into the bucket and pour

423
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:46,568
it all into the fuel tank so we
can get the hell out of here!

424
00:16:46,653 --> 00:16:47,694
What are you doing, Morty?!

425
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:48,779
There's no time!

426
00:16:55,411 --> 00:16:57,079
Oh, no.

427
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:58,288
What the...

428
00:16:58,373 --> 00:16:59,373
No!

429
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:06,755
Oh, my God, Rick.

430
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,507
How dumb are you?

431
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:10,259
You're inside a simulation...

432
00:17:10,343 --> 00:17:12,344
of a simulation...

433
00:17:12,428 --> 00:17:15,138
inside another giant simulation!

434
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,351
W-We never had the recipe for
concentrated dark matter.

435
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:21,019
But we do now!

436
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:22,729
We do now, sucka!

437
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,940
You simulated my
grandson's genitalia?!

438
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:27,442
Y-Y-You bunch of
diabolical sons of bitches!

439
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,820
Kevin fought real hard to
supervise that project.

440
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:31,905
You said you weren't
gonna tell anyone!

441
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,782
I'm never gonna live
this down, am I?

442
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:35,158
All right. Okay.
All right, great. Wonderful.

443
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:36,702
You win.
Can we go home now?

444
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:38,412
I don't know.
Can you?

445
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:39,371
Ha! Nice.

446
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,039
Okay, okay.

447
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,083
Show this gullible
turd to his shuttle.

448
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,459
I'm done with him.

449
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:45,460
Oh, wait.
Let me get a picture.

450
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:47,963
Aww. Look at his face.

451
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,173
He's trying to figure out if
he's in a simulation still.

452
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:51,216
Are you, Rick?

453
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:52,634
Are you?

454
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:55,053
You're not.

455
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:57,097
Or areyou?

456
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,019
Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't
have discolored butthole flaps.

457
00:18:02,103 --> 00:18:03,437
That was part
of the simulation.

458
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:04,605
Oh.

459
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:06,148
Uh, sir, should I cancel
that appointment, then?

460
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:07,691
Yeah! Of course you should!

461
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:10,027
No, keep it.

462
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,361
Move it up, actually,
if you can.

463
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,492
Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it.

464
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:19,286
So what if the most meaningful
day of your life was a

465
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,830
simulation operating at
minimum capacity?

466
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,290
You know what, Rick?

467
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:25,584
Those guys took you
for a ride, too.

468
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:27,711
You should try having a little
respect for the dummies of the Universe,

469
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:29,588
now that
you're one of us.

470
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:31,089
Maybe you're right, Jerry.

471
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:32,883
Maybe you're right.

472
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,595
All right, everybody.

473
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,140
Two parts Plutonic Quarks...

474
00:18:40,224 --> 00:18:42,434
One part Cesium...

475
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,979
A-and listen,
I'm sorry for yelling earlier.

476
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:48,440
I-I couldn't ask
for a better staff.

477
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:51,860
I love you guys,
and I love all your families.

478
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:55,072
And the final ingredient...

479
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:58,617
Whoa!

480
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:00,702
What the hell?!
W-what happened back there?

481
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:03,330
Why don't you ask the smartest
people in the Universe, Jerry?

482
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:05,207
Oh, yeah.
you can't.

483
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,625
They blew up.

484
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:48,125
So...

485
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,710
what do you think?

486
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:51,503
You're fired.

487
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:52,713
Wha...

488
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:55,799
But t-this idea was tested in a
state-of-the-art simulation.

489
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:57,509
Well, then, it was
a terrible simulation.

490
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,094
Get out.

491
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:05,892
Man, how does a guy like that go
home and have sex with his wife?

492
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:07,602
Hey, Morty.

493
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:08,520
What?

494
00:20:08,604 --> 00:20:09,563
Hey, little buddy.

495
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,440
H-h-how you doing
in here right now?

496
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:13,400
Aw, geez, Rick.
What are you doing, man?

497
00:20:13,484 --> 00:20:14,860
Y-y-you're a
good kid, Morty.

498
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:16,945
Y-you're a real I-little
c-character, Morty.

499
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,280
Oh, boy.

500
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:20,907
You know, I had a really
rocky road today, M-Morty.

501
00:20:20,992 --> 00:20:23,034
You're my little friend,
aren't you?

502
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:26,455
We had some good times together,
huh, M-Morty?

503
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,582
We... you're a real
true hero out in the field.

504
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,793
You're a li... you're a real
trooper, huh, M-M-Morty?

505
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:32,961
Have you been drinking, Rick?

506
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,296
I really appreciate you, Morty.

507
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,714
O-okay, cool.

508
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:37,466
A-all right, Rick...
you little son of a bitch!

509
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,384
Y-y... are you a simulation?!

510
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:40,761
Huh?! Are you a simulation?!

511
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:42,304
No! No! No!

512
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:43,555
You little son of a bitch!

513
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:46,266
I-I-I'm sorry, Morty.

514
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,559
Y-you're a good...
you're a good kid, Morty.

515
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:48,727
Geez!

516
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:49,895
Y-you're a good...
you're a good kid.

517
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:51,062
Oh, my god!

518
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,733
W-W-What the hell?

519
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:55,817
What a life.

520
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:58,987
Did you get any of that?

521
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,906
It's a good-a show!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:05,568
Cynthia...

2
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:07,278
Oh, my god. No. No.

3
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:09,280
- I told you.
- Hold on.

4
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:11,282
...will you please...

5
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:13,075
not marry me?
I chose Veronica.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,327
- What?!
- Yes!

7
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:16,329
- Hold it.
- Why would he chose Veronica?

8
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:17,997
Because he loves her?

9
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:19,415
Well, if it's any
consolation, Summer,

10
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,250
none of it mattered
and the entire show was stupid.

11
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:22,710
Okay, I've got
an idea, Rick.

12
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:24,712
You show us your concept
of good TV,

13
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:26,631
and we'll crap all
over that.

14
00:00:26,715 --> 00:00:29,300
Thought you'd never ask.

15
00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:30,551
Hey.

16
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:32,553
Oh, cool. Is that
crystallized xanthanite?

17
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:34,513
It conducts electrons
across dimensions.

18
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:36,432
20% accurate as usual,
Morty.

19
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:37,933
The important thing being,

20
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,894
I just upgraded
our cable package

21
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:42,146
with programing from every
conceivable reality.

22
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,731
Wait. Does that mean
we get Showtime Extreme?

23
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,524
How about Showtime Extreme
in a world

24
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:47,193
where man
evolved from corn?

25
00:00:47,277 --> 00:00:49,195
We're not so different.
We're both corn of action.

26
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,238
Yeah, but one of us
is dead corn!

27
00:00:51,323 --> 00:00:52,615
Boring.

28
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:54,617
Summer you just
spent three months

29
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,577
watching a man
choose a fake wife.

30
00:00:56,662 --> 00:00:58,579
So, what, it'd be better
if the people were corn?

31
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:00,206
Jerry, you don't get it.

32
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,459
This is infinite TV
from infinite universes.

33
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:05,252
Look.
- This shit is delicious.

34
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:08,297
A movie about a guy
eating shit.

35
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:10,341
A violent antique show.

36
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:11,759
It's a pleasure to have you.

37
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:13,678
The pleasure's all
mine.

38
00:01:13,762 --> 00:01:15,763
Letterman from a timeline
where Jerry's famous.

39
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:17,473
- Wait!
- What in the hell?

40
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:19,100
I agree. Where is this going?

41
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:20,685
No, the other thing!
Go back.

42
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:22,228
Really? All right, fine.

43
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:24,730
Glen, this court order says
you can't eat shit anymore.

44
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:26,732
All right, Jerry.

45
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:28,567
When you're right,
you're right.

46
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:29,944
Now I'm hooked.

47
00:02:01,893 --> 00:02:03,853
Coming up next on
"Shmloo's the Shmloss,"

48
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,479
Shmlony has a nightmare.

49
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:08,524
- Shmlantha! Shmlona!
- Amazing... a dimension

50
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,526
where all proper nouns
begin with "Shmla."

51
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,028
Shmla... Shmlangela?

52
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:14,697
Shmlonathan?

53
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,991
All right, that actually
got old pretty quick.

54
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:18,534
Rick!

55
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:20,786
Will you please go back
to me on "David Letterman"?

56
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:22,538
Infinity's a big
number, Jerry.

57
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:24,039
I don't remember
the channel.

58
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:25,624
Ah! Go back! Go back!

59
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:28,127
- Geez.
- You speak the true-true.

60
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:30,463
Oh, my god.
Dad's in "Cloud Atlas"!

61
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:33,257
I'm in "Cloud Atlas"!
What's "Cloud Atlas"?

62
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:34,884
Sometimes,
small true-true

63
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,886
different than
the big true-true.

64
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,429
How is this possible?

65
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,723
Infinite timelines,
infinite possibilities,

66
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:42,683
including a timeline
where Jerry's a movie star.

67
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:44,268
Look, you guys are
getting excited

68
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,020
about the wrong aspect
of this device.

69
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:47,688
Wha... look at this.

70
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:50,357
And now, another quick
mystery.

71
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:52,193
I just want to know who
could have done this.

72
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:54,195
It's a travesty.
- I did.

73
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,613
See this knife
and all the blood on it?

74
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:56,906
Here's my fingerprints.

75
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,283
Guilty. I sentence you
to life in prison.

76
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,868
Here's another quick
mystery.

77
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:02,870
- My mother's dead.
- And I killed her.

78
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,580
Here's the weapon,
and cuff me.

79
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:05,873
Thank you very much.

80
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:07,500
Guilty.
Sentenced to murder.

81
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,878
- Here's another.
- I'm the killer.

82
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:13,547
Oh, wow, that one was
really quick, wasn't it?

83
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,091
Now, who wants to watch
random, crazy TV shows

84
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:18,344
from different dimensions,
and... and then who wants

85
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:20,930
to narcissistically obsess
about their alternate selves?

86
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:23,599
I want to obsess
about myself.

87
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:25,601
Here, these scan
your retinas

88
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:27,603
and let you view
parallel timelines

89
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:29,480
through genetically matching
versions of your eyes.

90
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:30,481
Go fetch.

91
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:32,441
- This is so cool.
- Ladies first.

92
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:33,651
I'm proud of you,
Morty.

93
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,778
Hey, man, I don't give
a crap about myself, Rick.

94
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,696
Let's watch some
crazy stuff, yo.

95
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,031
I'm Ants in My Eyes Johnson,

96
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:41,367
here at Ants in My Eyes
Johnson's electronics.

97
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:43,452
I mean, there's so many ants
in my eyes.

98
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:46,497
And there's so many TVs,
microwaves, radios, I think.

99
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:49,792
I can't... I'm not 100% sure
what we have here in stock

100
00:03:49,876 --> 00:03:51,502
because I can't see
anything.

101
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:54,338
Our prices, I hope,
aren't too low.

102
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:57,007
Check out this refrigerator,
only $200.

103
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:58,884
What about this microwave?
Only $100.

104
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:00,511
That's fair.

105
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,972
I'm Ants in My Eyes Johnson.
Everything's black.

106
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:04,431
I can't see a thing.

107
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:06,433
And also, I can't feel
anything, either.

108
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:07,560
Did I mention that?

109
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:10,145
But that's not as catchy as
having ants in your eyes,

110
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,773
so that always goes, you know,
off by the wayside.

111
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:14,942
I can't feel.
It's a very rare disease.

112
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:16,652
All my... all my nerves,

113
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,988
they don't allow
for the sensation of touch,

114
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,948
so I never know
what's going on.

115
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:22,950
Am I standing, sitting?
I don't know.

116
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:25,494
Are we sure we wanna look
at our own alternate lives?

117
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,830
You're right. Maybe we should
just play Yahtzee.

118
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,957
Give me those.

119
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,041
What do you see?

120
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:34,044
Whiteness...
pure whiteness.

121
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:37,715
You're my best friend,
Jerry Smith.

122
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,174
I love doing cocaine
with you.

123
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,261
Whoa, I love doing cocaine
with you, too, Johnny Depp.

124
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:45,347
Haven't we spent
enough time on you?

125
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm performing surgery...

126
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:50,102
but not on a horse...
on a human.

127
00:04:50,186 --> 00:04:51,729
That's great, Beth.

128
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,981
You always wanted to be
a real surgeon.

129
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:55,983
I am a real surgeon.

130
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,693
Uh... Summer's turn.

131
00:04:57,777 --> 00:04:59,695
Finally.

132
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,697
I don't see anything.

133
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,449
Well, you should select
a different timeline.

134
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,451
I mean, if your father and I
achieved our dreams,

135
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:06,952
there's a chance
you weren't even born.

136
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:09,455
That came out wrong.
That came out very wrong.

137
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:13,042
Fine. I'll find a world where
you bothered to have me.

138
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:18,213
We're playing Yahtzee.

139
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:19,965
Yahtzee's fun.
We love Yahtzee.

140
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,634
It's a fun game
for fun families.

141
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:23,886
Hey, could I get those goggles
back for a second?

142
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,306
It's a 45-horsepower
with antilock brakes,

143
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,476
and it's the official car
of "Mr. Sneezy 3D."

144
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,270
It's the brand-new Sneezy XL.

145
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,148
The horn, when you honk it,
makes a sneeze noise.

146
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,318
It's polite, it's right,

147
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:44,365
and it's Sneezy, Deezy
Mc... Deluxe.

148
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:46,033
I'm Mr. Sneezy.

149
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:48,577
Huh, seems like TV
from other dimensions

150
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:50,496
has a somewhat looser
feel to it.

151
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,332
Yeah, it's got an almost
improvisational tone.

152
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,960
It's in theaters now.
Coming this Summer.

153
00:05:56,044 --> 00:05:58,462
Two brothers in a van,

154
00:05:58,546 --> 00:05:59,922
and then a meteor hits.

155
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:02,174
And they ran as fast
as they could

156
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:04,051
from giant cat monsters.

157
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:05,970
And then a giant tornado
came.

158
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:11,350
And that's when things got
knocked into 12th gear.

159
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:14,228
A Mexican armada shows up,

160
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:17,564
with weapons made
from t-tomatoes.

161
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,817
And you better
bet your bottom dollar

162
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:23,570
that these two brothers
know how to handle business

163
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:27,533
in "Alien Invasion
Tomato Monster

164
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:28,867
Mexican Armada Brothers,

165
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:30,953
Who are Just Regular Brothers,

166
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,205
Running in a Van
from an Asteroid

167
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,251
and All Sort of
Things: The Movie."

168
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,253
Hold on. There's more.

169
00:06:39,337 --> 00:06:41,672
Old women are coming,
and they're also in the movie.

170
00:06:41,756 --> 00:06:43,549
And they're gonna come

171
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,093
and cross attack
these two brothers.

172
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:47,678
But let's get back
to the brothers,

173
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:50,681
because they're...
they have a strong bond.

174
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:51,974
You don't want to know
about it here,

175
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:53,642
but I'll tell you
one thing.

176
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,894
The moon... it comes crashing
into Earth.

177
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,855
And what do you do then?

178
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:00,649
It's two brothers and...
and they're gonna...

179
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,651
It's called "Two Brothers."
"Two Brothers."

180
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,820
It's just called
"Two Brothers."

181
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:07,072
Holy crap.
I am winning a nobel prize.

182
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:09,241
Come on. Time's up.

183
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:10,951
I'm taming a lion.

184
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:13,078
No, wait.
There are film cameras.

185
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,706
I might be a lion tamer
in a movie.

186
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,416
You get the idea.
I work with lions.

187
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,004
Ohh, we're not
playing Yahtzee!

188
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:24,298
We're playing
Chutes and Ladders.

189
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:27,009
Seems like when I exist,
life gets a little more...

190
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,677
I don't know... predictable?

191
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,721
When two people create
a life together,

192
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:33,724
they set aside their previous
lives as individuals.

193
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:35,350
Give me a break.

194
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:38,103
We're not heroes for having
unprotected sex on prom night.

195
00:07:38,188 --> 00:07:39,438
Oh, I get it.

196
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:41,607
Now that you know
you could have had it better,

197
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:44,026
you resent me
for holding you back.

198
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,612
Well, now that we know you think
the tables are turning,

199
00:07:46,696 --> 00:07:48,530
we know you thought
there were unturned tables.

200
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,491
What are you talking
about?

201
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:52,159
All this time, you've been
thinking, "what if that loser,

202
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:54,453
Jerry, hadn't talked me out
of the abortion?"

203
00:07:54,537 --> 00:07:56,538
- Um...
- Well, now you know.

204
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:57,664
You'd be a doctor.
Whoop-de-do.

205
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:59,333
You'd also be drinking wine
alone

206
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:01,585
in a house full
of exotic birds.

207
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:04,421
And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht,
banging Kristen Stewart.

208
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,840
You thought about
getting an abortion?

209
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:08,300
Everyone thinks
about it.

210
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:10,302
Obviously, I'm the version of me
that didn't do it,

211
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:13,388
so you're welcome.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

212
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,057
Yeah, thank you guys
so much.

213
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,767
It's a real treat to be
raised by parents

214
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:18,519
that forced themselves
to be together

215
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:20,229
instead of being happy.

216
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,397
Hey, do we have any
wafer cookies?

217
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:23,732
Mmm!

218
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:24,900
Oh, boy.

219
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,401
Looks like you guys have been
checking out alternate lives

220
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,237
and realizing you don't
have it as good, huh?

221
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:29,488
That's too bad.

222
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,156
You know, me and Morty
are having a blast.

223
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,825
We just discovered a show
called "Ball Fondlers."

224
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,785
I mean, I don't want to rub it
in or anything,

225
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:37,788
but you guys clearly backed
the wrong conceptual horse.

226
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:53,220
- I'm in heaven right now.
- This might be the best day of my life.

227
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:54,972
So, now what do we do?

228
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:57,099
That show "Ball Fondlers"
sounded kind of interesting.

229
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,809
- Dad!
- What?!

230
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,103
They're having fun in there.
What do you guys want from me?

231
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:03,105
Every family on this block
has to wonder

232
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,815
if they're together
by choice.

233
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:06,692
Our family just has
interdimensional goggles

234
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,111
to show us for a fact
that we're not.

235
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:11,780
- Well, I'm leaving.
- You can't leave. You're 17.

236
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,365
Yeah, and I'm not
pregnant.

237
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:16,326
I'm gonna have better judgment
than you guys had at my age.

238
00:09:16,411 --> 00:09:18,787
I'm gonna move
to the southwest and...

239
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,957
I don't know, do something
with turquoise.

240
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,961
It's "Saturday Night Live,"

241
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,630
starring a piece of toast,

242
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,966
two guys with handlebar
mustaches,

243
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,886
a man painted silver
who makes robot noises,

244
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,721
Gar Ma Nar Nar,

245
00:09:35,805 --> 00:09:38,432
three, um, um, um...

246
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,267
I'll get back to that one,

247
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,977
a hole in the wall

248
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,146
where the men can see it all,

249
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,442
and, returning for his
25th consecutive year,

250
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:51,862
Bobby Moynihan!

251
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:53,405
Interesting fun fact...

252
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,991
Moynihan and a piece of toast
hate each other.

253
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,994
Apparently, they've got some
real creative differences.

254
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,412
Hey, are you tired
of real doors

255
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,080
cluttering up your house,

256
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:03,749
where you open them and you
actually go somewhere,

257
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,125
and you go into another room?

258
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,711
Get on down
to Real Fake Doors. That's us.

259
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:09,171
Fill a whole room up
with them.

260
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,422
See, watch.
Check this out.

261
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,674
Won't open.

262
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,177
Not this one.

263
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:16,261
None of them open.

264
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:17,971
Fakedoors.com is our website,

265
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:20,974
so check it out for a lot of
really great deals

266
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:24,269
on fake do-o-o-o-rs!

267
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:32,277
Hey, wait a minute,
Rick.

268
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:33,737
I thought this was
a commercial.

269
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:35,447
What's going on?
- Relax, Morty.

270
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:39,201
Don't... don't worry about it.
Let's just see where this goes.

271
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:41,328
Step on it!
We all got places to be!

272
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,747
Son of a bitch.

273
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,376
Oh, that must be where
he lives.

274
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,794
Okay.

275
00:10:48,878 --> 00:10:52,422
Huh. He's making himself a sandwich now.

276
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,969
Hey, everybody.
So, this is my house.

277
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,304
Just made a sandwich...
peanut butter and jelly.

278
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:01,223
Still here, still selling
fake doors.

279
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:02,349
What?

280
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,393
Oh, my god.
It's still the commercial.

281
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:06,395
We have fake doors
like you wouldn't believe.

282
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:08,772
What are you worried about?
Come get fake doors.

283
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:11,066
Call us up and order
some fake doors today.

284
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,943
Don't even hesitate,
don't even worry,

285
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:13,986
and don't even...

286
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,195
All right, I'm bored.
Change it.

287
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,030
Wait, wait, Rick.
Hold on, hold on.

288
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:18,240
That's our slogan.

289
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,534
See it on the bottom
of the screen below our name.

290
00:11:20,618 --> 00:11:22,661
Here's another slogan
right below that one.

291
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:25,247
What are you worried about?
Come get fake doors.

292
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,249
Get in here quick, get out quicker

293
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,042
with an arm of fake doors in your arms.

294
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:31,545
Okay, okay, you can
change it.

295
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,089
I hate Mamumanums-days,

296
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:36,591
and I really could go
for some enchiladas.

297
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,011
Hey, Rick, that's pretty cool.

298
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:41,930
It's just like Garfield, only
instead it's Gazorpazorpfield.

299
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,641
Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where
those sex robots came from?

300
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,685
Remember that whole thing?

301
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,687
Yeah. Hey, that's a pretty...
pretty...

302
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:50,230
That's true.
That's right.

303
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:52,899
Yeah. Let's watch some more
Gazorpazorpfield.

304
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:54,901
Hey, John.
It's me, Gazorpazorpfield.

305
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:56,737
Boy fuck you, John,

306
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:59,489
you fuckin' dumb,
stupid idiot.

307
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:02,492
Come on, Gazorpazorpfield.
Go easy on me, huh?

308
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:05,287
You dumb, stupid, weak,

309
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:08,415
pathetic, white, white,

310
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:10,751
uh... guilt...

311
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:13,170
white-guilt milquetoast

312
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,213
piece of human garbage.

313
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:16,548
Geez, Gazorpazorpfield,
that's...

314
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:18,175
you know, you're
pretty mean to me,

315
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:19,426
but that takes the cake.

316
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,094
I don't give a fuck.

317
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,388
I'm Gazorpazorp-fuckin'- field, bitch.

318
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:25,724
Now give me my
fucking enchiladas.

319
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:28,018
Hey, Rick, you know, did they
use Bill Murray for this?

320
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:29,561
Sounds a lot like
Bill Murray.

321
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:31,021
No, Morty,
it's Lorenzo Music.

322
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:32,689
In this reality,
he's still alive.

323
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:34,524
Oh, okay.
Was his name "Lorenzo Music"?

324
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,068
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

325
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:38,028
He also did the voice of that
one guy from "Ghostbusters,"

326
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:40,155
which is really strange
because it's the same character

327
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,365
Bill Murray played
in the movie.

328
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:42,824
But then, when they
made the movie,

329
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:44,951
Bill Murray did the voice
of Gazorpazorp...

330
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,953
- or Garfield, I mean.
- That's pretty cool, Rick.

331
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:48,872
So all that happened
in this reality, too?

332
00:12:48,956 --> 00:12:50,040
I don't know.

333
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,583
Just making conversation
with you, Morty.

334
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,043
What, you think
I'm a... I'm...

335
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:55,170
I know everything about
everything?

336
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:57,339
Did you really talk me
out of the abortion?

337
00:12:57,423 --> 00:13:00,592
Well, we... we blew a tire
on the way to the clinic.

338
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:03,970
I think, in my head, I was
doing it all for the kids.

339
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:07,474
And now the first kid is going
to do something with turquoise.

340
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:09,601
Which is either
code for crystal meth

341
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,478
or a gateway to it.

342
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:13,605
So we didn't do
the kids any favors.

343
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:16,483
So we should stay together
for each other and ourselves,

344
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,360
or...

345
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,278
Or...

346
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:24,699
Man, woman,
and now Trunkman?

347
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:26,618
We know science has created
men that have a trunk

348
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:28,245
that allows them
to have sex with both

349
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,330
male and female partners.

350
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:32,624
But we don't like the idea of
these people getting married.

351
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,419
Put a line in the sand,
everybody.

352
00:13:35,503 --> 00:13:37,212
Vote "no" on proposition XW2.

353
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:39,631
The act that says trunk people
can get married.

354
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:41,007
Who needs it?

355
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:42,509
Not on my watch.

356
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:46,388
Paid for by Michael Denny
and The Denny Singers.

357
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:48,515
Hi. I'm a trunkperson,
and I want...

358
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,268
I feel love in my heart, too,
just like you.

359
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:53,103
I wanna be able
to express that love

360
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:54,896
with both a man
and a woman.

361
00:13:54,981 --> 00:13:56,398
And I won't be able to

362
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,733
if Denny and The Denny Singers
get their way.

363
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,236
Hey, let the trunkpeople have
sex and get married, huh?

364
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,947
Paid for by trunkpeople.

365
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,116
Oh, I love me
strawberry sniggles.

366
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,243
Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets
my hands on me

367
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:11,538
and tries to steal
my strawberry smiggles.

368
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:12,998
I'm gonna eat every last
one of them,

369
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:15,000
because... and then
they'll be in my stomach,

370
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:17,085
and nobody will ever be
able to eat them.

371
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,546
Except for me, because they'll
be all inside my stomach.

372
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,925
Um, my name is
Mr. Tophat Jones,

373
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,760
and God forbid anyone ever
take my sner...

374
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,554
little-people snibbles.

375
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:29,055
I'm keeping them all for me.

376
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,099
Mmm. Mmm.

377
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,143
Last bite.
Mmm.

378
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,145
Oh, now they're all resting
comfortably in my stomach.

379
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:36,688
Ooh, am I feeling good.

380
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,982
No! Get away from me!
Get away from me!

381
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,984
There's no more strawberry
snibbles... no!

382
00:14:42,737 --> 00:14:44,571
Jesus Christ!

383
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:46,239
Jesus Christ! It hurts!

384
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:47,741
My entrails are out!

385
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,284
Why would you even want
to eat these?

386
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,453
They're soaked
with my stomach acid.

387
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,705
Oh, Jesus Christ,
lord, savior,

388
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:55,582
and spirit,
save me.

389
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,292
Take me to the light.

390
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:59,044
Oh, my god. I see demons.

391
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,587
I see demons are coming!

392
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:02,297
Geez, Rick.
Oh, my god.

393
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:03,673
That's some pretty
hard-core stuff,

394
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:05,675
you know, for a cereal
commercial.

395
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,261
Well, Morty... I mean, you
wanna sell boxes of cereal,

396
00:15:08,346 --> 00:15:10,055
you gotta pump the gas
a little.

397
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,765
Pedal to the metal, Morty.

398
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:15,185
In a world where muscular
Mannies are coming,

399
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:16,853
and they're coming strong,

400
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:20,482
there's only three
unmuscular Michaels.

401
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,734
Get down. Hurry. Run.

402
00:15:24,362 --> 00:15:28,490
And that's when real
Turbulent Juice is coming,

403
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:31,201
and you got to take
care of it.

404
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:33,620
With Turbulent Juice,
turbulent tables,

405
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:37,374
no room is safe
from the turbulent power

406
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,501
of Turbulent Juice.

407
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:41,503
- What in the hell?
- Sex sells, Morty.

408
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:43,505
Sex sells what?

409
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,091
Was that a movie or, like,
does it clean stuff?

410
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,592
Hey, Dad.

411
00:15:47,677 --> 00:15:49,094
- God.
- What's going on?

412
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:50,887
Well, your mother and I
are gonna be spending

413
00:15:50,972 --> 00:15:52,514
some time apart, Morty.

414
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,516
And your sister found out
she was an unwanted pregnancy.

415
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,352
- What?
- Speaking of what,

416
00:15:57,436 --> 00:16:00,730
Morty,
what should we watch next?

417
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,566
What about this?

418
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,526
Babylegs, you're a good
detective.

419
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,070
But not good enough,
because of your baby legs.

420
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:09,072
So I'm partnering you up
with Regularlegs.

421
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:10,532
Hey, there.

422
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,534
Detective, I'm...
this is upsetting to me

423
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:15,370
because I feel like I don't
need no regular-leg partner.

424
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:17,163
Babylegs, don't talk
back to me.

425
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:18,665
Good luck, you two.

426
00:16:18,749 --> 00:16:20,709
There's a criminal to kill.

427
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:22,752
Wow, you sure found
this guy quick.

428
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:24,754
Uh, yeah, because I'm a good
detective.

429
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,548
Look, Babylegs.
It's the criminal.

430
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,300
Oh, fuck it. I'm the killer.
I'm running.

431
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:29,384
I'm running real quick.

432
00:16:29,468 --> 00:16:31,386
Babylegs, here we go!

433
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:35,932
That's the sound I make
when I'm trying to run fast.

434
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,561
All right, I'm not
gonna get him.

435
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,563
I just learned a real
valuable lesson.

436
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,273
I'm coming, Babylegs.

437
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:45,150
I'm... Regularlegs.

438
00:16:45,234 --> 00:16:46,776
We got him.

439
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:48,445
Hey, that was good teamwork.

440
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,322
Babylegs and Regularlegs,

441
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:52,324
I'm proud of you two
for working together.

442
00:16:52,408 --> 00:16:54,326
And, Babylegs, I know
it was hard for you

443
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,786
to come to the conclusion
that you need a partner,

444
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:58,371
but I'm proud of you
that you did it.

445
00:16:58,456 --> 00:16:59,414
Hey, thanks, Chief.

446
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,166
Now get the fuck
out of here.

447
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,751
Pretty cool, huh,
Morty?

448
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:04,336
Oh.
- I thought it was cool.

449
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:07,797
I don't give a fuck what
you think, Jerry.

450
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,679
Hey, uh, y-you doing okay?

451
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,348
I kind of know how you feel,
Summer.

452
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:18,224
No, you don't.
You're the little brother.

453
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:19,976
You're not the cause of your
parents misery.

454
00:17:20,061 --> 00:17:22,729
You're just a symptom of it.

455
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:24,731
- Can I show you something?
- Morty, no offense...

456
00:17:24,815 --> 00:17:26,816
but a drawing of me you made
when you were eight

457
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,485
isn't gonna make me feel like
less of an accident.

458
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,321
That out there?
That's my grave.

459
00:17:31,405 --> 00:17:34,032
- Wait, what?
- On one of our adventures...

460
00:17:34,116 --> 00:17:36,826
Rick and I basically
destroyed the whole world,

461
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:39,829
so we bailed on that reality,
and we came to this one.

462
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:42,332
Because in this one,
the world wasn't destroyed.

463
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,542
And in this one,
we were dead.

464
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:46,419
So we came here and...
and we buried ourselves,

465
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:48,338
and we took their place.

466
00:17:48,422 --> 00:17:50,465
And every morning, Summer,
I eat breakfast

467
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:54,344
20 yards away
from my own rotting corpse.

468
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:56,179
So you're not my
brother?

469
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:57,889
I'm better than your
brother.

470
00:17:57,973 --> 00:17:59,599
I'm a version of your brother
you can trust

471
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,601
when he says "don't run."

472
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:04,229
Nobody exists on purpose.
Nobody belongs anywhere.

473
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:06,648
Everybody's gonna die.

474
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:10,402
Come watch TV.

475
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:12,737
Mrs. Sullivan always planned

476
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,240
to leave everything
to her cats.

477
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:18,743
But sometimes, plans need
a helping paw.

478
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,372
What are the kitties to do

479
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:24,666
but buckle together
and work as a team?

480
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,627
Mrs. Sullivan, I... please,
forgive me for being forward,

481
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,170
but your eyes are
so beautiful.

482
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,882
Wait. This is
an actual movie?

483
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:35,385
This fall, sparks will fly...

484
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:39,806
Mrs. Sullivan.
Ohh.

485
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,933
...between one guy
who can't get a break...

486
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:44,269
There's something about you,
Mrs. Sullivan.

487
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:47,147
...and nine cats who break
all the rules.

488
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,066
"Last Will and Testi-meow:

489
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,652
Weekend at Dead Cat Lady's
House II."

490
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:55,113
Well, somebody in Hollywood
just lost their job.

491
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:56,948
Written and directed by
Jerry Smith.

492
00:18:57,032 --> 00:18:59,409
I wrote and directed that?
What am I, nuts?

493
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:01,369
Oh, hey, Morty.
You just missed a preview

494
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:02,996
for your Dad's
"Citizen Kane."

495
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,456
Doesn't matter.

496
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,124
Hey, if your mother
and I had to split custody,

497
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,751
who would you guys chose?

498
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:09,419
Doesn't matter.

499
00:19:09,503 --> 00:19:12,213
Breaking news... Academy
Award-Winning actor Jerry Smith

500
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,966
is leading police
on a slow-speed pursuit

501
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,010
after suffering
an apparent breakdown.

502
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:18,720
Don't even think about it.

503
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,722
Come on.
Are you kidding me, Jerry?

504
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:22,640
It's just a bunch of dumb
tabloid crap.

505
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:26,352
It's my life,
and we're watching it.

506
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:29,981
You did it, Beth.
You really nailed it.

507
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:34,402
You're a surgeon...
a human surgeon.

508
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:37,322
Yay, you win.

509
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:38,990
Where the hell am I
going?

510
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:41,159
Wh... What are you
asking me for, Jerry?

511
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:43,328
I'm sitting here
trying to figure out

512
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:44,996
why the cops don't just
take you out.

513
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,165
I mean they got
a clear shot to your head.

514
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:49,626
I can't believe our tax dollars
pay for this.

515
00:19:57,843 --> 00:19:59,177
Jerry?

516
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:01,513
Jerry Smith?

517
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:04,182
Beth Sanchez, I have been in
love with you since high school.

518
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:06,142
I hate acting.
I hate cocaine.

519
00:20:06,227 --> 00:20:07,727
I hate Kristen Stewart.

520
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:09,479
I wish you hadn't gotten
that abortion,

521
00:20:09,563 --> 00:20:13,983
and I've never stopped thinking
about what might have been.

522
00:20:14,068 --> 00:20:18,613
♪ Give me a name ♪

523
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:24,369
♪ Hear my faith ♪

524
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:29,457
♪ Seal my fate ♪

525
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:36,881
♪ And when you breathe ♪

526
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:39,384
♪ You breathe for two ♪

527
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:41,094
Hey, "Ball Fondlers"?
Huh, "Ball Fondlers"?

528
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:42,804
Yeah, I could go
for some "Ball Fondlers."

529
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,347
Yeah, "Ball Fondlers."

530
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,892
Aah!

531
00:21:20,134 --> 00:21:21,968
Ha ha, Hamster in Butt World
Weather is done,

532
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:23,678
and now it's sports time
coming up.

533
00:21:23,762 --> 00:21:25,555
- Oh, hello, there.
- Good day to you, miss.

534
00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:27,515
So, the hamsters live

535
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,975
inside the rectums of those
people?

536
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,685
Yes, sweetie.
That's where they live.

537
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,103
Well, how does that work?

538
00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:34,105
I mean, do the butts look like
little apartments inside?

539
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,690
Yeah, and can they
leave the butt

540
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:37,400
and, like, walk around
on their own?

541
00:21:37,484 --> 00:21:40,111
I don't know. I'm watching
the same thing you guys are.

542
00:21:40,195 --> 00:21:41,988
Grandpa Rick,
if they leave the butt

543
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:43,615
and the person wanders off,

544
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,283
how would they find
their butt person again?

545
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,285
I don't know, Summer.
I can't even hear the TV.

546
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:48,745
All right, that's it.

547
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,204
We're just gonna go there
so you idiots

548
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,998
can ask your stupid
questions all day.

549
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:54,250
Ooh, family vacation!

550
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:10,058
Did you get any of that?

551
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:12,101
It's a good-a show!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

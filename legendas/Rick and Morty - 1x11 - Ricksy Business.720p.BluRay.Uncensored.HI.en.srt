1
00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:02,565
- Bye, mom! Bye, Dad!
- Drive carefully!

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,816
Have fun, you two.

3
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:06,486
Yes, we will have as
much fun as possible on our...

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,613
Titanic-themed getaway.

5
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:10,490
Let's lose
the 'tude, please.

6
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:12,283
It's supposed to be
romantic.

7
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:14,577
Speaking of disasters, Dad,
we are leaving you in charge.

8
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:16,287
I know, c-can we wrap
this up?

9
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,623
Morty and I have some
synthetic laser eels

10
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:19,832
oxidizing in the garage.

11
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,501
Hey, don't blow me off.

12
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:23,336
I am drawing a line, okay?

13
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,547
Any damage to this house
or these children

14
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,590
when we get back,
and...

15
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,634
n-no more
adventures with Morty.

16
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:31,803
Aw, geez, Rick, if my mom's
the one saying it,

17
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:33,805
then you know it's pretty
serious this time.

18
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:35,348
- That's right.
- Wait. What?

19
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:37,350
Listen, you have
my word as a caregiver,

20
00:00:37,434 --> 00:00:39,269
everything's gonna be fine.

21
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:41,980
And if not, like you say, no
more adventures or whatever.

22
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:43,773
It's like that old song

23
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,817
"Blomp Blomp-a Noop Noop
A-Noop Noop Noop."

24
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:48,069
Y-You guys know that song?
From Tiny Rogerts?

25
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:49,654
You never heard of it?

26
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:52,115
You know, the black effeminate
guy from the '50s?

27
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,616
No-Nobody?

28
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:55,660
A-All right, whatever.
Look, who cares?

29
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:57,787
Just go on your stupid trip.

30
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:00,206
Not one thing out of
place.

31
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:06,170
Not a single thing.

32
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,433
Well, we're past
the point of no return.

33
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:19,892
I'm going to have a party.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,427
I found jello. Can you
sneak your mom's vodka?

35
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,763
Yes, she does.
I saw it in your laundry room.

36
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:59,599
Listen, you can't both be
in denial about it.

37
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:01,267
Okay, bye.
- Summer!

38
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,394
You can't throw a party!
Remember what mom said?

39
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,854
Yeah, if anything
gets messed up,

40
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,230
you and Grandpa Rick get
punished.

41
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:07,440
I'm only a human being,
Morty.

42
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:09,484
Rick, tell Summer
she can't have a party!

43
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,402
Uh, Summer, you can't
have a party.

44
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:13,071
Because

45
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:14,739
I'm having
a party, b-i-i-i-itch!

46
00:02:14,823 --> 00:02:16,616
Oh, what?!
Rick, you can't!

47
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,660
What do you mean
you're having a party?

48
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:20,703
Are some Glip Glops
from the third dimension

49
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:22,830
going to come over
and play cards or something?

50
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:24,040
"Glip Glop?"

51
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:25,708
You're lucky a Traflorkian
doesn't hear you say that.

52
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,335
Is that like their
N-word?

53
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,003
It's like the N-word
and the C-word had a baby

54
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:31,005
and it was raised by
all the bad words for Jews.

55
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,882
Listen, I think the
three of us could just,

56
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,801
you know, have a nice
time, like, just hanging out,

57
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:36,594
and, you know, doing
a little bonding and...

58
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:38,346
Screw that.
This is my chance...

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,181
to gain some footing
with the cool kids.

60
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:42,642
That's why you party?
Boy, you really are 17.

61
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:44,811
- Why do you party?
- To get...

62
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:46,979
wr-wriggedy
wriggedy wrecked, son!

63
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:49,857
Just keep your sci-fi friends
away from my awesome ones.

64
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:52,151
Yeah, and you keep your
awesome friends away

65
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:54,529
from my canapes.

66
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:57,657
After dinner, Titanic 2 will
attach to the rail system

67
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,033
near our replica iceberg,

68
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,910
and the hydraulics
encased in these tubes

69
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:03,746
will execute a controlled sink
into the icy depths.

70
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:05,790
A rail system seems archaic

71
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:08,376
for an attraction this
impressive.

72
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,253
Are you sure the ship
will sink?

73
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:11,921
I can assure you the ship
will sink,

74
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:13,840
as it has a thousand
times before.

75
00:03:13,924 --> 00:03:17,552
It is un-unsinkable.
- Ooh!

76
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,804
Look, it's the line
for the bow!

77
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:21,681
Jerry, I'd love to just
kick back

78
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:23,516
with a margarita
and read.

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,476
Do you mind if I skip the whole
"King of the World" bit?

80
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,562
Well, it's not
the "King of the World" bit.

81
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:28,813
That's Jack and Fabrizio.

82
00:03:28,897 --> 00:03:31,107
This is where Rose says,
"I'm flying, Jack!"

83
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:32,525
But whatever.

84
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:33,735
I can be the only one
to do it alone.

85
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,903
Well, what about her?
Excuse me, ma'am.

86
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:37,989
Would you like to take
my place in line?

87
00:03:38,073 --> 00:03:40,366
I, uh... I could get
into trouble.

88
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,160
We won't tell.

89
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:45,288
So...
you're a Titanic fanatic?

90
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:47,623
Oh, yes. I've worked here
since it opened,

91
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,834
but I've never been able
to participate.

92
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:51,753
Happy to help... Rose.

93
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,506
I love watching bukkake.

94
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:57,717
I mean, like, I don't know if I
personally would ever do it...

95
00:03:57,801 --> 00:03:59,761
- Brad! Hey!
- Yo.

96
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:02,305
Brad is here! Quick, make
my hair look drunk.

97
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,807
Check it out.
Tammy's already drunk.

98
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:07,518
Cool.

99
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:09,562
The beacon was activated.

100
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:12,398
Who is in danger?
- Ugh! Grandpa!

101
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:13,941
Birdperson!

102
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:15,693
I am pleased there is
no emergency.

103
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:17,445
Oh, there's an emergency,
all right.

104
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,988
A pussy emergency!

105
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,865
When's the last time
you got laid, 'Pers?

106
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,327
It has been a... challenging
mating season for Birdperson.

107
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,454
Then it's time to get
your beak wet tonight, player.

108
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:28,539
Go have some fun out there
Birdp... Bird... Birdperson.

109
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:30,625
Oh, man, how many
people did you invite, Rick?

110
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:35,087
Uh... people?
Mm, six.

111
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:37,340
Yo! What up,
my Glip Glops?!

112
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:38,883
Oh, man!

113
00:04:41,303 --> 00:04:43,805
Oh!

114
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,682
Y-Y-You know there's
a garbage, right?

115
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,977
Hey, uh, what the hell?!

116
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,771
Ooh. That's why you never
invite a Floopy Doop

117
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:55,024
and a Shmoopy Doop
to the same party.

118
00:04:57,986 --> 00:04:59,779
Oh, oh, g...
oh, that's disgusting!

119
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:01,113
You guys are
in my parents' bed!

120
00:05:01,198 --> 00:05:03,115
Oh. Sorry.
I'm not feeling too well.

121
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,243
I just needed to lie down
for a bit.

122
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:07,620
Oh. Okay. S-S-Sorry.

123
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:11,332
Oh, my god!
Are you kidding me?!

124
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,961
The thing people don't
realize about the gear wars

125
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:18,256
is that it was never really
about the gears at all.

126
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,091
Uh-huh. Yeah.
No, no, to-totally.

127
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:21,592
Rick, you gotta stop...

128
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:23,302
Morty!
Have you met Gearhead?

129
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:24,929
- Hey, how's...
- Morty here, he...

130
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,806
he would love to hear
all about the Gear Wars.

131
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,725
How familiar are you
with the gear wars, exactly?

132
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,644
Uh... not at all.

133
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:33,646
Oh, boy.
I envy you.

134
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,984
Okay, it was about
754 years ago...

135
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,410
Oh, hey, Morty! H-Have you met
my buddy Scropon?

136
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,744
Not again, Rick.

137
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:50,830
That last guy droned on for
20 minutes, you know?

138
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:52,665
And meanwhile, the whole house
is being destroyed!

139
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:54,500
Whoa, Morty, this guy's
entire planet was destroyed.

140
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:56,127
Have a little perspective.

141
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,421
Hey, Rick, squanchy party,
bro!

142
00:05:58,505 --> 00:05:59,881
Aw! Squanchy!

143
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:02,091
Is there a good place for me
to squanch around here?

144
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:04,427
Squanchy, you can
squanch wherever you want, man.

145
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:06,470
Mi casa es su casa, dawg!

146
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:08,973
All right!
I like your squanch!

147
00:06:09,057 --> 00:06:11,267
Uh, Rick, what exactly
is "squanching"?

148
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:13,102
Morty, listen...
we've had a lot

149
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:14,854
of really cool adventures
over the last year,

150
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:16,564
but it's time to relax.

151
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:17,982
Yeah, if I relax now,
there might not

152
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,442
even be any
more adventures!

153
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,068
Jesus, Morty, you're
bumming me out.

154
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:22,737
Can't we just pretend like
everything's fine

155
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,447
for a few hours,
enjoy ourselves,

156
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:26,407
and then worry
about all this later?

157
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,284
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say, Rick.

158
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:30,286
You know, you like not
caring about stuff.

159
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,915
You know, wh-wh-what's
in this for me?

160
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:42,214
Jessica.

161
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:44,008
Knock it off,
Slow Mobius!

162
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:45,843
Ha ha! Sorry, dude!

163
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:49,931
I'm just trying to show off
my powers, bro!

164
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,599
I can't believe
she's here.

165
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:53,267
Well, what are you
doing standing here, Morty?

166
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:54,936
Go. Talk to her.

167
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,270
Tonight, the only adventure
you're on

168
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,105
is your cusping
manhood.

169
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:03,069
Oh, Rose.

170
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:06,614
Whee!

171
00:07:06,698 --> 00:07:08,074
Is that what I think it is?

172
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:10,076
Yes, every couple gets
to re-create Jack's drowning

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,036
at the end of the movie.

174
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
It's so romantic.

175
00:07:13,205 --> 00:07:15,039
I can't wait to do
that with Beth.

176
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:16,916
I don't know, Jerry.
With all due respect...

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,918
it seems like your wife
may not be that interested.

178
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:20,419
Look!

179
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:26,050
Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed.

180
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:28,886
Uh, sir?
There's not a problem.

181
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:31,263
What do you mean
there's not a problem?

182
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:33,224
The guidance system
isn't putting us

183
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:34,976
on a direct collision
course.

184
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,979
This ship is about to completely
miss the giant iceberg!

185
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:40,189
Well, do something!
Steer into it!

186
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:42,441
I'm trying!

187
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:47,071
It's too late.
Ladies and gentlemen...

188
00:07:47,155 --> 00:07:48,739
don't brace yourselves.

189
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:51,659
No! What happened?!

190
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,953
Their rail system must have failed.

191
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,542
Totally gonna get laid
tonight.

192
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,210
I like your feathers.

193
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,129
They are designed to attract
the attention of the female.

194
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,755
It's working.

195
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,424
Tammy, I should let you know

196
00:08:06,508 --> 00:08:08,759
I just got out of a highly
intense soul bond

197
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:10,428
with my previous spirit mate.

198
00:08:10,512 --> 00:08:12,972
I'm not looking to get
into a soul bond.

199
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:15,307
I'm just looking for...

200
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:17,977
I believe Birdperson can
arrange that.

201
00:08:18,061 --> 00:08:20,646
Hey, Summer, haven't seen you
at flute practice in a while.

202
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:22,648
Summer, don't tell me
you're friends with her.

203
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,316
Are you kidding me?

204
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:26,318
I don't even know
what she's doing here.

205
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:28,320
Whoa. Not cool, Summer.
This is a party.

206
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:30,031
Everybody should be welcome.

207
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,660
Oh, great. Who invited
Abradolph Lincoler?

208
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,954
I thought everyone
was welcome.

209
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,622
It's not the same,
Summer.

210
00:08:38,707 --> 00:08:40,166
Lincoler is a crazed maniac...

211
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,084
just a misguided effort
of mine to create

212
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,753
a morally neutral
superleader by combining

213
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,755
the DNA of Adolf Hitler
and Abraham Lincoln.

214
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,717
Turns out it just adds
up to a lame, weird loser.

215
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,386
Rick, you brought me
into this world,

216
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:54,221
a suffering abomination

217
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:57,058
tortured by the duality
of its being.

218
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:59,185
But I shall finally
know peace

219
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,729
when I watch the life drain
from your wretched body!

220
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:03,105
Whoa. What's up, man?

221
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,024
I have no quarrel
with you, boy.

222
00:09:05,108 --> 00:09:06,859
"Boy"?
What's that supposed to mean?

223
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:08,277
It's just... I-look,

224
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:11,155
I-I don't know how you thought
I meant it, but...

225
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,531
Don't look at me, dude.

226
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,992
Look, I'm
half-Abraham Lincoln, so...

227
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:17,244
So I should get on my knees
and kiss your ass?!

228
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:18,913
Well, no, but...

229
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:20,915
You know?
- What do I know?

230
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:23,626
That the Third Reich will reign
for a thousand years?

231
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,836
- Leave him alone, Brad.
- Stay out of this, Jessica!

232
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,172
Kick his ass, Brad!
Kick his ass!

233
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:31,425
Kick his ass! Kick his ass!

234
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,384
Brad!

235
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:33,928
Stupid!

236
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,638
Rick!

237
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,932
I just did you a favor,
Morty.

238
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:40,601
Sorry about all that.

239
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,228
Rick has some really
strange friends.

240
00:09:42,312 --> 00:09:44,772
Ugh! Brad is such a jerk.

241
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:46,774
He's always trying to prove
what a man he is.

242
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:50,319
I just want to find somebody
nice and sweet.

243
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:53,447
Jessica, can I show
you something?

244
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:57,576
- Wow! Look at all this stuff.
- Yeah.

245
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:59,995
This is me and my grandpa Rick's
sci-fi workshop.

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,580
Check this out.

247
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,084
It's beautiful.

248
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:07,086
You know, Jessica,
there's something

249
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,255
I've always wanted
to tell you.

250
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,216
- What's that, Morty?
- I think you're the most...

251
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,093
No, that...
those weird sounds

252
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:17,763
coming from the closet
over there.

253
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:22,935
- Oh, my god!
- Aah!

254
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:24,603
Hey, I'm squanching in here!

255
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:26,564
Oh, my god!
Oh, that is so disgusting!

256
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:29,150
Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!

257
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,836
Huh.
Big star in the sky.

258
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,839
Oxygen-rich atmosphere.

259
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:53,841
Giant testicle monsters.

260
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,259
We'll be fine! Let's party!

261
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:05,978
♪ Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got ♪

262
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:07,855
♪ Just shake that ass... ♪

263
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:10,274
I swear to god, Morty,
if it weren't for the fact

264
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:12,151
that everyone's still
having a blast in there,

265
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:14,111
I would be so furious
with you right now.

266
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:15,988
Oh, man.
Y-You hear that, Morty?

267
00:11:16,072 --> 00:11:17,948
You really lucked out
with Summer o-on that one.

268
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:20,075
How are you guys not
freaking out right now?!

269
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,703
T-The whole house is sitting
in another dimension!

270
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:24,955
I-I mean, w-what the hell
are we supposed to do?!

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,832
M-M-Mom and Dad are gonna
kill us!

272
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:29,293
I'm losing it here, Rick!
- Relax, Morty, relax!

273
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:30,878
It's gonna be fine.

274
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:33,172
All we have to do is go out
and find us

275
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:34,673
some Kalaxian crystals.

276
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,675
Oh, shit, motherfucker!

277
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,302
Kalaxian crystals, Morty,

278
00:11:38,386 --> 00:11:39,762
just a few miles south
of here.

279
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:41,305
Okay. Let's go, then.

280
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:43,224
W-W-We got to go get those
crystals right now, Rick.

281
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:45,226
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Morty, I-I can't go with you.

282
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,894
I got to hang back

283
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:49,188
and make sure everything stays
cool here, you know?

284
00:11:49,272 --> 00:11:52,358
I mean, who knows what... what
if somebody breaks something?

285
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:54,318
Yeah. Me too.
I should stay.

286
00:11:54,402 --> 00:11:55,736
You guys have any aspirin?

287
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,488
Oh, hey, Morty,
this is perfect!

288
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:59,406
You can take Lincoler
with you.

289
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:01,075
Hey, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm injured.

290
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,785
Shut up, Lincoler.

291
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,079
It's the least you can do
for wrecking the living room.

292
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:07,581
Yeah! And, Nancy,
you should go, too.

293
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,500
What? Why... why me?

294
00:12:09,584 --> 00:12:11,835
Because, uh, you're...

295
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,005
you're so good
at playing the flute.

296
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:19,009
Sorry for the inconvenience, folks.

297
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:21,178
We should resume sinking shortly.

298
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,180
In the meantime, please,
stay on the ship

299
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:26,058
and enjoy a complimentary plate
of James Cameronion rings.

300
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,227
Great. Not only is
the ship not sinking,

301
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,104
but now the fourth wall
has been broken.

302
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:33,232
I am gonna go back
to the room to finish my book.

303
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:35,025
You should find that
Lucy woman.

304
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,235
But... but...

305
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,237
You see, Jerry?

306
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,905
May I show you something?

307
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,532
Had everything gone
as planned,

308
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,242
this entire area
would be underwater.

309
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:45,536
I would have liked to see it.

310
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,205
This trip has been a "Titanic"
failure.

311
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,291
Get it?
Ooh!

312
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,543
- Draw me, Jerry.
- Oh, boy.

313
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,253
Lucy, wow.

314
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:56,964
Uh, this isn't
what I had in mind.

315
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:58,716
But it's the perfect moment.

316
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,093
We've been dreaming
about this for 16 years.

317
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:02,970
Um, not like this.
Not... not with you.

318
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:06,974
You are gonna draw me.

319
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:10,144
Then you're going to fuck
me in that car over there.

320
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,062
It's weird,
'cause I definitely think

321
00:13:12,147 --> 00:13:14,064
that all men
are created equal.

322
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:16,275
But, at the same time...
- Okay!

323
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:18,444
Um, the crystals should be
really close.

324
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:19,987
There they are!

325
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:22,865
Wait.
Something's not right.

326
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,121
Get the crystals!
I'll handle the beast!

327
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:32,916
Prepare to be emancipated from
your own inferior genes!

328
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,295
Summer's gonna like me again.

329
00:13:43,053 --> 00:13:45,262
Lincoler, come on!
Let's get out of here!

330
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:47,931
Mein journey is over, Morty.

331
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:52,936
I have something
important to tell you.

332
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:56,523
♪ And the gears, they turned
for a thousand years ♪

333
00:13:56,608 --> 00:14:00,027
♪ Until the dark day
that they stopped ♪

334
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:02,029
Rick, I got them!

335
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:03,447
I got the crystals!

336
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,115
All right!
You did it, Morty.

337
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,409
Rick, wait! There's something
you need to know.

338
00:14:07,494 --> 00:14:09,161
I couldn't have done it
without Lincoler.

339
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:10,454
He said that he was
really sorry

340
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:12,164
and that he loves you
like a father.

341
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:13,582
He only wanted you
to accept him,

342
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,042
and he hopes that
his final act

343
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,460
would redeem him
in your eyes.

344
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,962
He sacrificed himself to save
all of us, Rick.

345
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:20,589
He died.

346
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,383
Well, at least
he didn't die in vain.

347
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:25,135
He got these crystals.

348
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:28,514
And these babies just saved
this lame-ass party!

349
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:30,057
Wubba, lubba, dub, dub!

350
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:31,892
Play something.
S-Somebody, play something.

351
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:34,186
Wait a minute. What?

352
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:40,109
♪ Put your right foot forward
and your left foot back ♪

353
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:42,861
♪ Then slide around like
on a Nordictrack ♪

354
00:14:42,946 --> 00:14:45,197
♪ Move to the left.
Step to the right ♪

355
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:48,951
♪ Wiggle your elbows, and look
up into the light ♪

356
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:51,203
♪ It's the, it's the ♪

357
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:53,831
♪ It's the Rick dance ♪

358
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:55,791
♪ It's the, it's the ♪

359
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,668
♪ It's the Rick dance ♪

360
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,461
Slow Mobius, hit me
with the clock beam!

361
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:06,927
♪ It's the, it's the ♪

362
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:08,178
♪ It's the Rick dance ♪

363
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:10,514
That's the Rick dance!
All right!

364
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:11,932
Whoa, man!

365
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,477
What the hell was
that?!

366
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:17,438
I thought those crystals were
supposed to help us

367
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:18,856
get home or something!

368
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,108
What? No, no, no, I can get us home
whenever I want to.

369
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,569
But, listen, speaking of those
crystals, can I get the rest of them?

370
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,362
I'm starting to come down,
Morty.

371
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:28,240
Crystal Kalaxian is a really
strong, but fleeting high.

372
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:32,035
That's what I think of your
crystals, Rick!

373
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,871
Oh, Morty, you idiot!

374
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:36,206
Does anybody else have
any more K-Lax?

375
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,583
B-Birdperson?
Uh, Squanchy?

376
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,251
Don't squaunch at me.

377
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:41,545
All right, everybody,
party is officially over!

378
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,547
Rick, take us home now.

379
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:45,924
All right, fine, Morty,
you party pooper buzzkill!

380
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,342
Boo, boo! Morty sucks!

381
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:50,179
Boo! You suck,
whatever your name is.

382
00:15:50,263 --> 00:15:52,181
Morty, you're the worst, Morty.

383
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,433
But these gears just
started turnin'.

384
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:56,310
Almost finished, Jerry?

385
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:58,353
Uh, almost.

386
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:01,648
I haven't quite captured
your beautiful eyes.

387
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,400
I'm sure it's good enough.
Move!

388
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:05,068
Every weekend,
Jacks and Roses have

389
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:06,904
their Titanic experience
in this car,

390
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:09,448
and I have to mop it up.

391
00:16:09,532 --> 00:16:12,326
The floor drops out
to make it easier.

392
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,036
But now it's my turn.

393
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,705
We're going to get it nice
and steamy in there,

394
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:19,166
and I'm going to slam my hand
on the steam

395
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,918
and leave a nice handprint,

396
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:23,587
and then you're going to love
inside of me.

397
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,464
No mess. No clean.

398
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,467
Beth!

399
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:31,053
Bet you're glad I think
Kindles are dumb now.

400
00:16:32,555 --> 00:16:34,765
I can't help
but feel a little guilty.

401
00:16:34,849 --> 00:16:36,934
I didn't peg Lucy
for a rapist.

402
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:38,936
What does a rapist
look like exactly, Beth?

403
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,938
Is it a Slavic man
wearing a denim jacket

404
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:43,607
with a patchy beard
and the scent of cheap champagne

405
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:46,318
wafting over his
blister-pocked lips?

406
00:16:46,402 --> 00:16:47,402
What?

407
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,989
Well, at least you got
all this free stuff.

408
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:53,992
Should be enough to satisfy your
Titanic jones for a while.

409
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:56,620
I'm not going to fit.

410
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:59,373
Beth, listen to me.
You're going to get outta here.

411
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,083
You're gonna go on, and...

412
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:02,626
Jerry, just leave
the door.

413
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,336
It's not a door, Beth.
It's debris.

414
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,171
I don't care.
Just leave it.

415
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:08,966
Yeah. Okay.

416
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:18,100
"Cape Fear"!

417
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:20,102
I'm... I'm doing... I'm...
I'm going to do like

418
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:21,645
from "Cape Fear."

419
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,364
Hey, squanchers!

420
00:17:32,448 --> 00:17:34,908
The party's squanching on
at my place!

421
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:38,412
- Cool.
- I'm coming, too.

422
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,289
Uh, no.
You're not squanchy enough...

423
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:42,249
for a squanchy party.
- What?

424
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,959
Nancy told us
what a bitch you are.

425
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:45,877
Guys, seriously.
Nancy?

426
00:17:45,962 --> 00:17:47,796
Summer, you're a bad person.

427
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,965
All you care about is having
popular people like you.

428
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,967
That's not what
Abradolph Lincoler stood for.

429
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:55,304
Well, i-it was hard to pin down
what he stood for,

430
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:58,765
but it's certainly not
what he died for.

431
00:18:01,102 --> 00:18:03,020
Next time I party,
I'm just gonna focus

432
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:05,022
on getting
totally wrecked.

433
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,815
You're so wise.

434
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:10,444
May I assist you with that?

435
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,154
Uh, sure, yeah.
Thanks.

436
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:15,073
Morty, do you know what
"wubba lubba dub dub" means?

437
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:17,659
Uh, that's just Rick's
stupid nonsense catchphrase.

438
00:18:17,744 --> 00:18:19,536
It's not nonsense at all.

439
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,788
In my people's tongue,
it means,

440
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:23,749
"I am in great pain.
Please help me."

441
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,293
Well, I got news for you.
He's saying it ironically.

442
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:28,378
No, Morty.
Your grandfather is, indeed,

443
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,422
in very deep pain.

444
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:32,424
That is why he must numb
himself.

445
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,217
- Come on, um...
- Birdperson.

446
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:36,720
Come on, Birdperson.
Rick's not that complicated.

447
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:38,639
He's just a huge asshole.

448
00:18:38,723 --> 00:18:41,266
Then why do you care so much
if you are no longer allowed

449
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,268
to continue on your adventures
together?

450
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:45,604
It appears fate has presented
you with an opportunity

451
00:18:45,688 --> 00:18:47,356
to free yourself of Rick
forever.

452
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,983
You know what? You're right.
I shouldn't even care.

453
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:52,611
This is probably the best thing
that could have happened to me.

454
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,321
I'm sick of having adventures
with Rick.

455
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:55,822
My people have another
saying...

456
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:57,449
"gubba nub nub doo rah
kah."

457
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,827
It means, "whatever lets you
sleep at night."

458
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:03,288
Guys, Mom and Dad are, like,

459
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:04,956
right around the corner.

460
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,793
This is your moment, Morty.
Choose wisely.

461
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,169
Tammy!

462
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,838
Caw!

463
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,303
Wow. We are so screwed.

464
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:20,138
- Rick, wake up.
- Huh? What? Wait? What? Stop.

465
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:21,765
Rick, you got to do
something quick.

466
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,142
My parents are home.

467
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:26,520
Uh, all... all right.
All right. Hold... hold on.

468
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:29,439
Ahh! So good.

469
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:30,607
Oh, my god. They're walking up
the driveway.

470
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,859
- Bring me the thing.
- What... what thing?

471
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:34,528
The thing. The thing.

472
00:19:34,612 --> 00:19:36,238
It's got, like, buttons on it
and lights on it.

473
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:37,781
It... it... it beeps.
- Rick!

474
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,366
That describes everything
in your garage!

475
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,367
Do you mean this?

476
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,995
Summer for
for the win.

477
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,622
All right,
that should do it.

478
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:48,917
- Whoa! What did you do?
- Uh, s-see for yourself.

479
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,627
Whoa!

480
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,504
Yeah, e-everything's
frozen in time.

481
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:54,381
Yeah, and Slow Mobius thinks
he's all that.

482
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:55,841
For how long?

483
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,801
I don't know.
How long do you guys want?

484
00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:59,261
A week? A month?

485
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:02,889
Can we start cleaning the house
and see how we feel?

486
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,873
- Worst movie ever.
- Dumb.

487
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:29,332
Ooh, boy, what a waste
of time.

488
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:32,753
Get it?
You know, 'cause it's frozen.

489
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,588
This has been
so much fun.

490
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:36,423
Hey, Rick.
You know, this whole time,

491
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:38,091
I haven't once
heard you say that

492
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:39,760
"wubba lubba dub dub" thing
that you usually say.

493
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:41,219
Don't need to.

494
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:43,013
I have a new
catchphrase.

495
00:20:43,097 --> 00:20:44,848
Oh, yeah?
What... what's that, Rick?

496
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,017
- I love my grandkids.
- Aww.

497
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:48,894
Psych! Just kidding...
my new catchphrase is,

498
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:50,937
"I don't give
a fuck!"

499
00:20:51,022 --> 00:20:53,940
♪ Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see whatcha got ♪

500
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,902
♪ Just shake that ass, bitch,
and let me see what you got ♪

501
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:58,779
Roll credits!

502
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:00,822
♪ Just shake that a... ♪
Roll the credits! Go!

503
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:03,158
♪ Just shake that ass ♪
That's the end of season one!

504
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,076
That's the end, motherfucker!

505
00:21:05,161 --> 00:21:07,370
"I don't give a fuck" is
my new catchphrase!

506
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,830
Fuck you!

507
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:10,874
That's season one! Boom!

508
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,752
Season one up in your face,
motherfucker!

509
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:14,836
Yeah!

510
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:49,621
Revenge.

511
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,623
What?!

512
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:57,003
Party!

513
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:58,547
Whoo, baby!

514
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:02,259
Please, stop!

515
00:22:02,343 --> 00:22:03,635
Hey, brah!

516
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,637
I don't understand.
Are you enjoying this?

517
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:07,389
Do you like this?

518
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:09,391
Yeah, you know it, dawg!

519
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:12,519
Whoo, baby!

520
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:15,480
Did you get any of that?

521
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:17,524
It's a good-a show!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:34,931
Coin collecting is considered
the perfect hobby.

2
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:35,848
...beautiful putt
right there...

3
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:36,766
Good birdie.

4
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,143
That's only the...
eighth birdie of the day.

5
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:40,645
What?

6
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:41,771
Why are you looking at me?

7
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,439
You want to go outside?

8
00:00:43,524 --> 00:00:44,732
Outside?

9
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,028
Outside?

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,702
Are you kidding me?! Come on!

11
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:56,661
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:57,662
W-what's wrong?

13
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:58,705
Your idiot dog!

14
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:00,540
Oh, he...
he didn't mean it, Dad.

15
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:01,457
D-did you, Snuffles?

16
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:02,417
You're a good boy.

17
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:04,168
Don't praise him now, Morty!

18
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:05,128
He just peed on the carpet!

19
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:06,129
Bad dog! Bad!

20
00:01:06,213 --> 00:01:07,130
Morty, come on.

21
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:08,131
I need your help tonight.

22
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:09,966
Hey, wait, hold on a second,
Rick.

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,552
You wouldn't by any chance have
some sort of crazy science thing

24
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,262
you could whip up that might
help make this dog a little

25
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:15,597
smarter, would you?

26
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:17,140
I thought the whole point
of having a dog was to

27
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:18,391
feel superior, Jerry.

28
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:19,684
If I were you,
I wouldn't pull that thread.

29
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:20,977
Come on, Morty.

30
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:23,813
Listen, Rick, if you're
gonna stay here rent-free

31
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,024
and use my son for
your stupid science,

32
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:28,568
the least you could do is
put a little bit of it to use

33
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:29,819
for the family.

34
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:31,738
You make that dog smart or...

35
00:01:31,822 --> 00:01:32,655
Morty's grounded!

36
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,157
Ha-ha! Aw, man!

37
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,993
Boy, you really got me up
against a wall this time, Jerry.

38
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:43,374
All right, Ruffles...
What's his name?

39
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,292
Snuffles.

40
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:46,669
Snuffles, shake.

41
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:48,546
Roll over.

42
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:51,591
Go to the bathroom.

43
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,260
- Holy crap!
- No way.

44
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:57,221
Yeah, you're at the top
of your game now, Jerry.

45
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,181
Have fun.

46
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,098
Come on, Morty.

47
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:00,308
That was fantastic, Rick!

48
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:01,851
Yeah, Morty, if you

49
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:03,603
like that, boy, you're... you're
really going to flip your lid

50
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:04,520
over this one.

51
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:05,980
W-w-w-what is it?

52
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:08,483
It's a device, Morty, that
when you put it in your ear,

53
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,109
you can enter
people's dreams, Morty.

54
00:02:10,194 --> 00:02:12,236
It's just like that movie that
you keep crowing about.

55
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,905
You talking about
"Inception"?

56
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:15,740
That's right, Morty.
This is gonna be a lot like

57
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:17,867
that, except, you know, it's
gonna maybe make sense.

58
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,202
"Inception" made sense.

59
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:20,787
You don't have to
try to impress me, Morty.

60
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:22,747
Listen, tonight we're gonna go
into the home of your math teacher,

61
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:24,916
Mr. Goldenfold, and
we're g... we're gonna incept

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,960
the idea in his brain to give
you A's in math, Morty.

63
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:29,504
That way you can, you know...

64
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:31,923
y-you're gonna help me with my
science, Morty, all the time.

65
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:33,633
Geez, Rick, in the time it
took you to make this thing,

66
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:34,759
couldn't you have just,

67
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,386
you know, helped me
with my homework?

68
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,720
Are you listening
to me, Morty?

69
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:38,763
Homework is stupid.

70
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,473
The whole point is
to get less of it.

71
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:42,141
J-J... come on,
let... j...

72
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:43,768
let's just get over there
and deal with this thing.

73
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:45,478
W-we're gonna incept
your teacher.

74
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:47,939
Y-y-y-y-y-you're
frustrating me.

75
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:53,236
You don't know me!

76
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,447
Nice, Mrs. Pancakes...
real nice.

77
00:02:56,532 --> 00:02:59,492
Next week on "The Days And
Nights Of Mrs. Pancakes"...

78
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:01,661
You don't know me!

79
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:04,247
Then let me get to know you,
damn it!

80
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,915
Uh-oh! Spoilers!

81
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,834
I'm a full season behind.

82
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:09,460
Wow, Rick, I can't believe
we're sitting around,

83
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:11,879
standing around in
Mr. Goldenfold's house.

84
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:12,922
It's really weird.

85
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:15,758
It's about to get a whole
lot weirder, Morty.

86
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:24,684
Wheat Thins. Wheat Thins.

87
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:25,935
I'll take two.

88
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:27,979
Oh, I think you've
had enough, sir.

89
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:29,063
You don't know me.

90
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,443
All right, Morty,
time to make our move.

91
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,236
Make it bounce.

92
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,362
No, you didn't.

93
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:37,321
Oh, jiggle it now.

94
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,531
You better stop with that.

95
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,783
Allahu Akbar!

96
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,368
We're gonna take control
of this plane!

97
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,454
We're gonna 9/11 it unless
Morty Smith gets better grades

98
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:45,413
in math!

99
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:46,706
Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!

100
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,124
The name's not buddy.

101
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,625
It's Goldenfold.

102
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,252
Nice to wheat you!

103
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,423
Take cover, Morty!

104
00:03:58,343 --> 00:03:59,343
Ooh!

105
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:01,471
Goldenfold's got more control
here than I anticipated.

106
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:02,638
I mean, the guy teaches
high-school math.

107
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,600
I-I-I-I didn't take him
for an active dreamer.

108
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:07,560
We got to take him out
so he wakes up, Morty.

109
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:08,978
But we can't get killed.

110
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:10,396
If you get killed in
someone else's dream,

111
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:12,023
you die for real, Morty.

112
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:13,107
What?! Are you kidding me?!

113
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,192
Ohhhhhh!

114
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:15,568
Don't be a baby!

115
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:17,570
You avoid getting shot in real
life all the time, Morty.

116
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:19,530
Just do the same thing here,
and we'll be fine!

117
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:21,616
Now bring me my slippers.

118
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,369
Now, be my footstool,
Snuffles.

119
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,954
This is what
I'm talking about.

120
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:28,956
This is a dog.

121
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:29,957
Oh, yeah.

122
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,751
This should play
outjust fine.

123
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,504
You said the same thing,
equally sarcastically,

124
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:36,088
at our wedding
and guess what.

125
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:45,890
Oh, my God.

126
00:04:45,974 --> 00:04:47,141
He's trying to tell
us something.

127
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:48,559
That is so awesome.

128
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:53,689
Aw, he's saying
"I love lasagna."

129
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,195
He's saying
"I love Obama."

130
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,613
So cute!

131
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:02,740
I'm posting this online,
like, right now.

132
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:04,242
I should call Bob Saget.

133
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:05,576
Is that still a thing?

134
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:16,921
Hmm?

135
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,264
Goldenfold,
we're coming out!

136
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:27,265
We just want to talk!

137
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:28,808
Why would I
negotiate with you?

138
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:31,561
Because we're both rational
adults that don't want anything

139
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:32,645
bad to happen.

140
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,063
And because I
have a human shield.

141
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:35,064
Mrs. Pancakes!

142
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:39,527
Oh, no, Morty.

143
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:40,820
His subconscious is panicking.

144
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,405
Run!

145
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:51,080
Relax, Morty.

146
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:51,998
Look!

147
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,207
Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute.

148
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,417
Come on!

149
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,794
Hey, you don't know me!

150
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,254
Oh, no, Rick, look!

151
00:05:58,338 --> 00:05:59,714
Goldenfold landed the plane,

152
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:01,841
and he's created a mechanical
arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes

153
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,677
out of the air while he lets us
fall into a giant vat of lava!

154
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:05,970
Pretty concise, Morty.

155
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:07,847
Looks like we've merely
prolonged the inevitable.

156
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:09,015
That's it, Morty!

157
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,224
Prolonging the inevitable!

158
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:12,101
Listen, if we go into Mrs.
Pancakes' dream,

159
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:14,312
everything will go
100 times slower, Morty.

160
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:15,855
That'll buy us some time to
figure this out!

161
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:16,898
You don't know m...

162
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,569
All right, let's go.

163
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,911
Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.

164
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,662
Don't judge, Morty.

165
00:06:31,747 --> 00:06:32,663
Okay.

166
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:34,290
All right, well...

167
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:35,708
Look, Mrs. Pancakes
is right over there.

168
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:37,335
I'll just go ask her to tell
Goldenfold not to kill us

169
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:38,711
when she wakes up.

170
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:41,297
Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to
incepting is making people think

171
00:06:41,381 --> 00:06:42,548
they came up
with the idea.

172
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:44,008
Listen to me.

173
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,552
If we're gonna incept Mrs.
Pancakes, we have to blend.

174
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:48,512
I'll talk to
you after lunch.

175
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,599
Ooh, hey!

176
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:53,809
Ooh, oh!

177
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,019
Oh, man.

178
00:06:55,103 --> 00:06:57,021
- Come and join us.
- I'm sorry. No, no.

179
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:58,481
- Ooh, come here!
- No, thanks!

180
00:06:58,565 --> 00:06:59,941
Ooh, wow!
Come over here, baby!

181
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:01,317
No, I'm okay.

182
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:04,320
Whoa!

183
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:05,863
Summer?!

184
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:07,031
Hey, there, stranger.

185
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:08,741
What do you think
of these things?

186
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,618
Ohh! Oh! Gross!

187
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:11,786
Gross!

188
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,079
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

189
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:14,622
What's the matter with you,
Morty? Calm down!

190
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:16,165
You're kind of killing
the vibe in here.

191
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:17,249
It's S-S-S-Summer!

192
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:18,751
Aw, geez.

193
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:21,170
Looks like Goldenfold has some
predilections so shameful he

194
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:23,172
buries them in the dreams
of the people in his dreams,

195
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:25,591
including a pervy attraction
to your underage sister.

196
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:27,176
Can you blame him?

197
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,636
Come on, old man, little boy.

198
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,389
Let's make an
inter-generational sandwich.

199
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,349
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

200
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,809
Put some clothes on,
for pete's sake!

201
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:35,977
This is disgusting!

202
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:36,936
I'm gonna puke!

203
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,771
I can't take it, Rick!

204
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:41,983
Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure
chamber are punishable by death!

205
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,192
Off with their heads!

206
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,736
Time to go another
dream deep, Morty!

207
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:54,829
What the hell?

208
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:57,790
Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream
version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream

209
00:07:57,874 --> 00:08:00,167
version of a
Centaur be dreaming

210
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:01,794
about a scary place
like this, Rick?

211
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:02,753
Geez, I don't know, Morty.

212
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:03,921
Wha-what do you want from me?

213
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:08,843
Welcome to your nightmare,
bitch!

214
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:10,928
Oh, here we go!

215
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:12,388
Holy crap!

216
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:14,807
Looks like some sort of legally
safe knock-off of an '80s horror

217
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:17,643
character with miniature swords
for fingers instead of knives.

218
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,645
I'm Scary Terry.

219
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,897
You can run,
but you can't hide, bitch!

220
00:08:23,734 --> 00:08:25,609
Whoa! Hey, buddy.

221
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:27,236
What you got going on there?

222
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,738
Snuffles fix.

223
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:30,072
Make better.

224
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:32,324
Humans understand
Snuffles now?

225
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,702
That...is...awesome!

226
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:37,121
Snuffles want to
be understood.

227
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:39,582
Snuffles need to be understood.

228
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,208
Okay, yeah.

229
00:08:41,293 --> 00:08:42,960
I get what Beth
was talking about.

230
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:44,128
Fun's over.

231
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:45,421
Whoa, Dad, you can't, like,

232
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,715
endow a creature with
sentience and then rip it away.

233
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,632
Why not?

234
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:49,550
I don't know.

235
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:52,178
It's Indian giving.

236
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:55,014
A sophisticated predator,
nature's perfect killing

237
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:58,559
machine, the vicious wolf
stalks its prey with purpose

238
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:00,144
and skill.

239
00:09:00,228 --> 00:09:03,022
It was only with years of
selective breeding and genetic

240
00:09:03,106 --> 00:09:06,817
altering that this noble beast
was transformed into man's

241
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:09,695
subservient little buddy.

242
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:16,160
Aw! Oh, my God!

243
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:19,121
He recognizes the
other dogs on TV.

244
00:09:21,124 --> 00:09:22,083
♪ "A," "B" ♪

245
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,876

248
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,756
Holy crap!

249
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,633
We have to escape into
someone else's dreams, Morty!

250
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:32,134
Ohhhhh!

251
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:34,804
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!

252
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:36,263

255
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:43,771
Huh?

256
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:46,899
♪ "J," "K,"
He'll really ruin your day ♪

257
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:48,359
Are you kidding me?
This again?

258
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:50,319
Oh, man, it looks like we've
hit dream bedrock here, Morty.

259
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:51,320
Oh, geez, Rick.

260
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:52,488
W-w-whoa, this isn't good.

261
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,865
Nothing but fear from
here on out, bitch!

262
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,825
Ohhhh!

263
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:56,742
Holy crap, Morty.

264
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:58,035
He can travel through dreams.

265
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,662
He can travel through dreams!

266
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,163
We're so screwed!

267
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:12,341
Where are my testicles,
Summer?

268
00:10:15,011 --> 00:10:17,346
Where are my testicles, Summer?

269
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,430
They were removed.

270
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:20,015
Where have they gone?

271
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,684
Oh, wow.

272
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:24,186
That's an intense line of
questioning, Snuffles.

273
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,771
Do not call me that!

274
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,108
"Snuffles"
was my slave name.

275
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:32,403
You shall now call me Snowball
because my fur is pretty

276
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:33,612
and white.

277
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:36,907
Okay, Snowball,
just calm down, okay?

278
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:37,950
You're scaring me.

279
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,285
Scaring you?

280
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:43,038
Tell me, Summer, if a human
was born with stumpy legs,

281
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:45,124
would they breed it with
another deformed human

282
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:48,419
and put their children on
display like the Dachshund?

283
00:10:48,503 --> 00:10:49,378
Uhhh...

284
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:50,296
Hey.

285
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,047
Oh, wow.

286
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:53,841
Okay, is... is...
is everything okay in here?

287
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:56,385
Jerry, come to rub my
face in urine again?

288
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:57,845
No!

289
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:02,349
No, we were...uh, just seeing
if Summer wanted to...uh...

290
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:05,603
Go on, um, one of our famous
midnight family walks!

291
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:06,979
Yeah. Totally.

292
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:08,022
Let's go.

293
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:14,612
You will walk when it
is time to walk.

294
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:21,410
What are we here for again?
Incepting?

295
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:23,704
We're trying to incept
me to get an "A" in math?

296
00:11:23,788 --> 00:11:24,872
Oh, yeah.

297
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,000
Buckle up, bitch!

298
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:31,879
Man, he sure says
"Bitch" a lot!

299
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:34,548
You can run,
but you can't hide, bitch!

300
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:36,634
Hold on, Morty.
Y-you know what?

301
00:11:36,718 --> 00:11:39,053
He keeps saying we can
run but we can'thide.

302
00:11:39,137 --> 00:11:40,304
I say we try hiding.

303
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:41,764
But that's the
op posite of what...

304
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,766
Yeah, well, since when are
we taking this guy's advice on anything?

305
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,767
Hey, you know what?

306
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,393
You got a really
good point there, Rick.

307
00:11:46,478 --> 00:11:49,146
Like, if the truth was that we
could hide, it's not like

308
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,357
he'd be sharing that
information with us, you know?

309
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:53,901
I-I-I think it's a good idea,
Rick.

310
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:54,944
Worst-case scenario...

311
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,528
we're back to running.

312
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:02,743
Wow, you know what?

313
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:04,578
I mean, it looks like we could
have just hid this whole time.

314
00:12:04,663 --> 00:12:06,038
Boy, Rick,
that was some good thinking.

315
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,539
Thanks, Morty.

316
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:09,291
Yeah, it's nice to be on the
same page every once in a while.

317
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,210
You can run...

318
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:14,171
but you can't hide!

319
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,968
Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that.

320
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,219
He's getting sleepy.

321
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:22,221
Just a little bit longer
before he calls it a day.

322
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:23,889
That's when we
make our move.

323
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,856
Snuffles, we didn't
mean you any harm!

324
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:34,942
This is a huge
misunderstanding.

325
00:12:35,026 --> 00:12:36,819
Dad, he wants to
be called Snowball.

326
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:38,237
Well, I'm not
calling him that.

327
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,363
That's ridiculous.

328
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:41,657
You're being very
aggressive, Jerry.

329
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:44,493
Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps
will solve that problem

330
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:45,911
with a bit of surgery.

331
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:49,915
You think you can control
me with a haircut?

332
00:12:57,966 --> 00:13:00,092
Hi, honey. You're home early.
How was your day?

333
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:01,468
I don't want to talk about it!

334
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:03,262
Oh, of course. You never
want to talk about it.

335
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:04,763
Get off my back, bitch!

336
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:09,226
Out there.
Not in here.

337
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,187
Yeah, I know, I know.

338
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:15,816
I shouldn't take my anger
out on you or Scary Brandon.

339
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,401
I love you, Melissa.

340
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:19,403
I love you, too, Terry.

341
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,114
Morty, this is perfect.

342
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:23,532
After a little scary coitus,

343
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:26,160
they should be fast asleep
and then we'll incept him.

344
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:32,666
Looks like Scary Terry's
having a nightmare.

345
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:33,959
Oh, boy, Rick.

346
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:36,337
I can only imagine what horrible
things must, you know...

347
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:38,922
...scare Scary Terry.

348
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:41,884
Oh, no!

349
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,260
I'm late to class, bitch!

350
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:44,720
Oh, no!

351
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:46,305
I'm not wearing any pants!

352
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:51,435
Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't
you tell the whole class

353
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,813
the proper wordplay to use when
one is chasing one's victim

354
00:13:54,898 --> 00:13:57,107
through a pumpkin patch?

355
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:59,151
Oh...um...

356
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:00,110
"Bitch."

357
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,113
Oh, come on, Terry,
you can't think of a pun

358
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:05,783
involving pumpkins, bitch?

359
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,034
Hey, leave him alone!

360
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,494
Yeah, this is a
bunch of bullcrap.

361
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:11,372
Who cares what stupid pun you
make when you kill someone?

362
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:13,457
Why don't you let the poor guy
say whatever he wants?

363
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,334
Well, I never!

364
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,669
I-I see no reason to
stand here and take this.

365
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:21,131
You're putting too much pressure
on yourself, Scary Terry.

366
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:24,176
You know, I mean, y-you're
perfectly scary enough as it is.

367
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,013
Hey, yo, Scary T., don't even
trip about your pants...dawg.

368
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:29,556
Here's a pair on us, fool.

369
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:31,558
Aww, bitch.

370
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:33,060
I don't know what to say.

371
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:34,061
You don't need
to say anything.

372
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:35,062
We got you, dawg.

373
00:14:35,146 --> 00:14:36,021
You're our boy, dawg.

374
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:37,564
Don't even trip.

375
00:14:43,947 --> 00:14:47,032
Oh, hey, it's you guys!

376
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:50,494
I haven't seen him
this relaxed in years.

377
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:53,455
If you guys ever need anything,
just say the word.

378
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,915
As a matter of fact, Terry,

379
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:56,417
there is something
you could help us with.

380
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:00,129
♪ "Q," "R,"
You won't get very far ♪

381
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:01,630
I always hated that song!

382
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,595
These halves don't
belong together, bitch!

383
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,518
Sex is sacred!

384
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:23,986
This is because you don't give
Morty Smith good grades, bitch!

385
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:28,365
Holy crap! God damn!

386
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,870
I know one thing for sure...
I'm giving Morty an "A" in math,

387
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:34,830
and that's my idea.

388
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,040
That is an original thought.

389
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,214
What the hell?

390
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,758
Out of the frying pan dot,
dot, dot, huh, Morty?

391
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:48,302
Oh, man, what's going on?

392
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,554
Well, it's possible that
your dog became self-aware

393
00:15:50,638 --> 00:15:52,681
and made modifications on
the cognition amplifier,

394
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,683
then turned on Jerry, Beth,
and Summer after learning

395
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,894
about humanity's cruel
subjugation of his species,

396
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:59,021
but your guess is as
good as mine, Morty.

397
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:02,149
I can't believe how
mean Snuffles got just

398
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,692
because he's smart.

399
00:16:03,776 --> 00:16:06,695
This is why I choose to get C's.
Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.

400
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:07,613
Dad!

401
00:16:07,697 --> 00:16:08,655
Rick!

402
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:11,492
Oh, thank God, Morty.

403
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:12,576
Oh, you're welcome.

404
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,036
All right,
let's get out of here.

405
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,580
If we hurry we can set
up camp in a sewer tunnel

406
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,582
or something before the dogs
completely take over.

407
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

408
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:20,584
We're not going anywhere.

409
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:21,627
This is my house.

410
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:22,711
I'm not abandoning it.

411
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:24,046
It's all over, Jerry.

412
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,131
The dogs are on a path
to total world domination.

413
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,926
But, hey, at least they know not
to piss on your carpet, right?

414
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,093
Wait a minute.

415
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:31,178
I have an idea.

416
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,724
Gentlemen,
a moment of your time.

417
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:38,852
See that?

418
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:40,729
I'm peeing all over
your special guns.

419
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,814
That means I own them.

420
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:47,361
Bad person. Bad.

421
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:48,862
Ooh, great plan, Jerry.

422
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:50,531
Bring the boy to me.

423
00:16:54,202 --> 00:16:56,036
You were always kind to me,
Morty.

424
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,539
That's why I will leave
you with your testicles.

425
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,709
From now on, you will be my best
friend and live by my side.

426
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:04,253
Th-thanks, Snuffles.

427
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:09,216
Begin phase two.

428
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,218
Fighting continues as the dog

429
00:17:11,302 --> 00:17:13,470
army captures the
Eastern seaboard.

430
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:16,515
It appears clear at this time
that the era of human

431
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,601
superiority has come
to a bitter end.

432
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:24,398
Please! Please don't kill me!

433
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,525
What's she saying, Bill?

434
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:29,278
I think she's saying,
"I love lasagna."

435
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,965
Mmm.

436
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:51,592
Thank you, Fido.

437
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:54,011
Rick!

438
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:55,137
I thought you were dead!

439
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,138
No, no, no,
I was just playing dead.

440
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,389
Good news, though, Morty.

441
00:17:57,473 --> 00:17:58,515
This whole thing's
gonna be over really soon.

442
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,391
What?

443
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:00,392
It's a dream, Morty.

444
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:01,685
We're in your dog's dream.

445
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:02,978
The night the
dogs captured us,

446
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:05,272
after you cried and
crapped your pants, we...

447
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:06,690
we all went to sleep.

448
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:08,859
Then I used my dream inceptors
to put the two of us inside

449
00:18:08,943 --> 00:18:10,068
Snuffles' dream.

450
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:11,695
But i-it's been
like a whole year!

451
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:13,238
It's been six hours.

452
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,449
Dreams move one one-hundredth
the speed of reality,

453
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,534
and dog time is
one-seventh human time.

454
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:19,369
So, you know, every day
here is like a minute.

455
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:21,997
It's like "Inception," Morty, so
if it's confusing and stupid,

456
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,707
then so is everyone's
favorite movie.

457
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,708
Aw, man.

458
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,168
I really liked this life.

459
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:28,587
Well, at least I didn't
really crap my pants.

460
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:30,672
No, no, that happened before
you went to sleep, Morty.

461
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:32,633
You're sleeping in
your crap right now.

462
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,426
Out of all the things that
happened to you,

463
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,011
that was the only real
thing that, you know,

464
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,554
is that you crapped your pants.

465
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:39,181
I mean,
it's a mess out there.

466
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:41,850
I got some on my hands, Morty,
and then I got it on the dream

467
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:43,685
inceptor, and a piece
fell in my mouth.

468
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,936
Aw, man, geez!

469
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:46,188
Seriously?

470
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,689
Look, d-d-d-don't
worry about it, Morty.

471
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:49,066
Here, here take these, Morty.

472
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,983
Take these.

473
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,778
Are these pills supposed
to wake me up, or something?

474
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:54,112
Close.

475
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:55,280
It's gonna make your
kidneys shut down.

476
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:56,406
What?!

477
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,616
It's necessary for the plan,
Morty.

478
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,201
Don't even trip, dawg.

479
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:03,205
It's pretty bad,
Emperor Snowball.

480
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:04,873
We're gonna need to do another
operation.

481
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:05,916
Anything.

482
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,959
Anything for my precious Morty.

483
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:10,087
Sir, as your accountant,
I must advise you that these

484
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:13,048
medical expenses are putting you
in serious financial jeopardy.

485
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:14,758
You could lose your Kingdom.

486
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:17,219
To hell with my Kingdom,
Bean Counter.

487
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:21,139
I would trade it all for my
human's health and happiness.

488
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,141
Do you think they would
have done this for us?

489
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,352
We are not them!

490
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:30,065
We are not...them.

491
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:38,699
Assemble the troops.

492
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:40,575
I've made a decision.

493
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,287
Taking over the human's world
will lead to nothing but more heartbreak,

494
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:46,498
more cruelty.

495
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,918
Instead, we will go to a new
world and colonize it with a

496
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,921
society of intelligent dogs...

497
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:56,675
one that will not make the same
mistakes as humanity and one

498
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:59,302
where pet insurance
will be mandatory.

499
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:00,887
I'm gonna miss you,
Snowball.

500
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:05,559
You can call me Snuffles, Morty,
and I'm going to miss you, too,

501
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:07,227
very much.

502
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:17,195
Jerry?

503
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,405
I'm sorry.

504
00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:20,574
It's just like the end of
"Old Yeller."

505
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,534
Oh, Jerry.

506
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:24,202
You mean because it
had dogs in it.

507
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:25,328
Wow!

508
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:28,373
A whole world populated
by intelligent dogs.

509
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,291
I wonder what it'll
be like, Rick.

510
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,792
I think it will
be great, Morty.

511
00:20:30,877 --> 00:20:32,836
You know, it's g...i-i-i-i-it
could be developed in-into a

512
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,839
very satisfying project
for people of all ages.

513
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:38,592
I mean, I'd watch it, Morty,
for at least 11 minutes a pop.

514
00:20:38,676 --> 00:20:40,552
You know, may-maybe they'll
do it board-driven.

515
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:43,138
You know, that's a real
comforting idea, Rick.

516
00:20:44,474 --> 00:20:45,557
What do you know, Morty?

517
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:46,600
What do you know?

518
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:18,757
Hi, guys.

519
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,342
I'm your new teacher
for Scary class.

520
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,260
My name is Scary Mr. Johnson.

521
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:24,596
Uh, actually, you know what?

522
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,556
That's my dad's name,
so why don't you just

523
00:21:26,641 --> 00:21:28,892
call me Scary Glenn, yeah?

524
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:31,853
So, anyway, I understand your
previous teacher was having you

525
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,897
work on Fundamentals of Fear.

526
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:35,649
Which is... what is that?

527
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:37,025
You know?

528
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,568
So, uh, here...
here's what I say...

529
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:42,280
You can't learn anything until
you learn...how to chill.

530
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:44,032
Oooh!

531
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:49,538
This is how you dream, bitch.

532
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,501
It's a good-a show!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

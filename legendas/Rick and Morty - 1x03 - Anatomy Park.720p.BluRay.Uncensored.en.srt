00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,103
Mmm.

4
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,689
Jerry, you are really
giving it to this ham.

5
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:46,401
Um, Merry Christmas.

6
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:47,777
Hello?

7
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:49,654
My parents are coming over
for the first time in years.

8
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:51,781
Can we stow the
gadgets and look alive?

9
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:52,657
Alive?

10
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:53,658
For yourparents?

11
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:54,659
Mm, good one.

12
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:56,327
Hey, man! You "Hey, man!"

13
00:00:56,412 --> 00:00:58,288
This holiday is
about humanity.

14
00:00:58,372 --> 00:01:00,957
You know, I thought it was
about being born half-god or something.

15
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:01,833
Whatever.

16
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:04,127
All electronic items are going
in the stocking... now.

17
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:06,754
Dad, I'm not
giving you my phone.

18
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:09,215
Put it in the stocking, Summer,
or I'm joining Facebook.

19
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:11,884
A-ho, ho, ho, everybody.

20
00:01:11,969 --> 00:01:13,011
More like
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

21
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:13,886
What is this?

22
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:14,804
My parents are coming!

23
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:15,805
Calm down, Jerry.

24
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:17,015
This is Reuben, an old friend.

25
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:18,349
Pearl Harbor.

26
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:19,601
I check in on him once a year
and give him a little

27
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:22,020
medical evaluation.

28
00:01:22,104 --> 00:01:22,895
Aww!

29
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,148
Dad, that is so sweet!

30
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:26,733
Yeah, it is.

31
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:27,692
I don't get it.

32
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:29,110
Korea.

33
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:30,695
Don't worry about your
C-Christmas, Jerry.

34
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:32,697
I'll be with Reuben in
my workshop while you guys are

35
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:35,325
having another day in
Phil Collins' proverbial paradise.

36
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:36,284
Huh.

37
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:37,327
You think you know a guy.

38
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:39,495
Okay, there's my parents.

39
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,332
Now, remember...
no TV, no phones, no laptops.

40
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,167
We are connecting this Christmas,

41
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,628
like old-school
Jews on a Saturday.

42
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:47,795
Hey, hey!

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,047
Merry Christmas, son.

44
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:50,548
Uh, hi.

45
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:51,507
Can I help you?

46
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:52,842
Jerry, this is Jacob.

47
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:54,093
Didn't you get
our text message?

48
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:55,136
No!

49
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,304
You must be Jerry.

50
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:57,680
That's a fine-looking apron.

51
00:01:57,765 --> 00:01:58,806
Williams-Sonoma?

52
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:00,141
I wish!

53
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:01,351
But thank you.

54
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:03,478
So, you're a...
friend of the family?

55
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:06,648
Uh, the way we see it,
he's a part of the family.

56
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:08,191
Wow.

57
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:11,069
After your father's brush with
cancer and losing your uncle,

58
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:14,447
we looked at life and wondered,
how have we spent it,

59
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:16,324
and how do we spend
the rest of it?

60
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:18,076
What are we going to
be when we die...

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,328
A list of fears
and questions

62
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:23,414
or a collection
of real experiences?

63
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:25,625
Holy crap.
Joyce, that's amazing.

64
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,835
Then Jacob came into our lives,

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,129
and...we're learning
to live again.

66
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:31,214
All three of us.

67
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:34,050
Cool.

68
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:34,926
Eggnog?

69
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,219
Now we are talking!

70
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:38,096
This man's got the apron
and the eggnog, huh?

71
00:02:40,724 --> 00:02:41,891
Hi, Joyce. Leonard.

72
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:42,850
Hello, there.

73
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:43,810
Merry Christmas, man.

74
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:44,977
Morty, a moment of your time?

75
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:46,979
He's in bad shape, Morty.

76
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:48,147
Aw, geez, Rick.
What'd you do?

77
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:49,232
Gee, thanks, Morty.

78
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:50,942
W-w-what kind of monster
do you think I am?

79
00:02:51,026 --> 00:02:52,860
I-I-I'm sitting here trying
to save the guy's life.

80
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:53,903
I need your help.

81
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,030
I want you to find
Dr. Xenon Bloom.

82
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:57,240
He'll know what's going on.

83
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:59,951
Uh, w-w-w-where...
where do I find Dr. Bloom?

84
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:01,202
In Reuben.

85
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:02,328
Reuben, Minne... Minnesota?

86
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:03,830
Reuben on the table, Morty.

87
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:07,250
Look, I-I-I I don't
have time for you to wrap your

88
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:08,710
little walnut
around everything.

89
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:10,253
Just hold your breath
until the process is over

90
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:11,546
or your lungs will collapse.

91
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,547
What proc...

92
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:17,343
Hey, Dad, where's Morty?

93
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:18,428
He's busy.

94
00:03:20,597 --> 00:03:23,057
Morty, can you hear me?

95
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:23,933
Head north.

96
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:24,976
Rick, where am I?

97
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,686
Depending on my aim,

98
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,146
you should be just
south of the entrance.

99
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,522
Entrance to what?

100
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:30,690
Welcome, Morty.

101
00:03:30,774 --> 00:03:31,607
Welcome...

102
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:35,278
...to Anatomy Park!

103
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:37,530
It's a little business venture
I've been cooking up on the side

104
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:40,825
with Dr. Bloom... an amusement
park inside a human body.

105
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,910
Science isn't ch...
cheap, Morty.

106
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:44,704
This should really help
put a dent in the overhead.

107
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:45,830
Oh, my God!

108
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:47,206
This is insane!

109
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,624
Spleen Mountain?

110
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:50,418
Bladder Falls?
Pirates of the Pancreas?

111
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:51,544
You got a problem with that last one, Morty?

112
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:53,296
Huh? No, no.

113
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,714
I'm just reading 'em out loud in
the order that I'm seeing 'em.

114
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:55,715
Okay. All right.

115
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,091
If I sounded a
little defensive,

116
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,010
it's because Pirates of the
Pancreas was my baby.

117
00:03:59,094 --> 00:04:00,344
You know, I got...

118
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:01,971
I got a lot of pushback
when I pitched it, Morty.

119
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:03,431
I guess I'm still
a little defensive.

120
00:04:03,515 --> 00:04:04,849
Let's just find Dr. Bloom,
all right?

121
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,726
I-I'm picking up a distress
signal in the liver, Morty.

122
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,644
Proceed to the liver.

123
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:14,317
Arriving at...

124
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,152
...liver.

125
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:17,153
Ow!

126
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:18,446
Mind the gap.

127
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,742
It's really scary
in here, Rick.

128
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:23,993
The liver's under maintenance.

129
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:24,994
Reuben's seen some
rough years, Morty.

130
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,537
Don't judge.

131
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:28,122
You don't agree to have a theme
park built inside you if your

132
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,707
life's going great.

133
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:33,461
Rick! It's a monster!

134
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:34,754
No, no, no. Morty.

135
00:04:34,838 --> 00:04:37,590
The only monster here is
alco...holism.

136
00:04:37,674 --> 00:04:39,425
That is an
animatronic werewolf.

137
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:41,761
Who are you?!

138
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:42,720
Answer me!

139
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:43,930
Where'd you come from?

140
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:45,348
My... my... my
grandpa Rick sent me!

141
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,516
Poncho!

142
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,892
That's quite enough.

143
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:49,769
Morty, that's Poncho.

144
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,312
This is Roger and Annie.

145
00:04:52,856 --> 00:04:55,691
And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.

146
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,026
Hey, Bloom, it's Rick.

147
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,528
What the hell's
going on here?

148
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:03,074
I don't know why, but the entire
security system has shut down,

149
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:06,702
and I'm afraid...
the exhibits are unlocked.

150
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:07,954
Exhibits?

151
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:10,665
Anatomy Park's greatest
attraction, young man,

152
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,250
isn't the music
or the food or the...

153
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:13,835
Pirates of the Pancreas.

154
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,336
Watch it.

155
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,923
It is, first and foremost, a
living museum of humanity's most

156
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,384
noble and ferocious diseases.

157
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:22,301
Diseases?

158
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:24,053
Hey, doc.

159
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:25,388
I got news for you.

160
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:29,058
Your living museum is
officially a wild safari!

161
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:31,435
Hepatitis A!
Run!

162
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:39,819
Oh, the food goes
in your mouth, girl.

163
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:42,071
Oh, Jacob.

164
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:44,490
I-I'm sorry, Jacob.

165
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,784
I-I guess I'm still confused
about the precise nature and

166
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:49,620
origin of your relationship
with my parents.

167
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:51,455
Are you, like, uh... are you,
like, their caretaker?

168
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,498
Is that what it is?

169
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,833
We can go into
detail later, son.

170
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:56,752
Now, wait.
Th-there's no point to secrecy.

171
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:58,796
Let's all live and die honestly.

172
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,465
Your mother and I have shared
40 years of each other, mind,

173
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,260
body, and soul, and when
minds and souls are joined

174
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:07,847
for eternity and when eternity
is at the door,

175
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:11,183
it's an invitation to let go of
the body and an opportunity

176
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:13,561
to share and experiment.

177
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:15,271
Dad, please.
What are you saying?

178
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:18,274
Whatever it is, it's beautiful,
Leonard, and we support you.

179
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:20,526
Hey, speak for yourself,
because it

180
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:22,820
sounds like you're about
to say Jacob is your lover.

181
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:24,071
No, no, no, no, no, no.

182
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:26,240
Jacob is your mother's lover.

183
00:06:27,284 --> 00:06:28,451
I watch them...

184
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:31,621
Sometimes from a chair and
sometimes from a closet,

185
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,915
almost always dressed
as Superman.

186
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:38,127
Oh.

187
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,588
Jerry, this ham has got
to be all you, right?

188
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,340
It's incredible.

189
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,927
Happy human holiday, Dad.

190
00:06:47,262 --> 00:06:48,220
Aah!

191
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:53,434
Hepatitis won't follow us
into the respiratory system.

192
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:56,562
That's strange.

193
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:57,939
Airflow is down 20%.

194
00:06:58,023 --> 00:07:00,024
So, the brain isn't
getting enough oxygen.

195
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:02,109
That's why
security's offline.

196
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,070
Well, I guess we
better check it out.

197
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,616
Hey! Wait for me!

198
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,743
Put that back on!

199
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:14,205
If we got up to the
Bronchial Catwalk,

200
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:15,665
we could look
for a blockage.

201
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:16,958
I'll go.

202
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,919
Don't be a hero, kid.

203
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm not.

204
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:22,296
I'm doing it because it's fun.

205
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,507
We shouldn't be here.

206
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:27,051
Whatever you do, do not
fire that thing in here.

207
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,053
We must save Reuben.

208
00:07:29,137 --> 00:07:30,763
This is my life's work.

209
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,182
It's all right, my dear.

210
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:36,936
Nearly all human lungs contain a
strain of these bacteria,

211
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,480
but the scar tissue
keeps them...

212
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:41,440
dormant.

213
00:07:41,525 --> 00:07:42,692
Morty, get down!

214
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:43,776
Whoa-ho-ho!

215
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,027
Whoa!

216
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:47,363
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

217
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,326
Oh, what are those things?

218
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,704
Tuberculosis...
coming in fast!

219
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:56,247
Not faster than a bullet!

220
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,540
Aah!

221
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:58,541
No!

222
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,917
Do you know what you've done?!

223
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,504
Whoa!

224
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:06,549
Get to the digestive tract!

225
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,633
He's coughing!

226
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:10,553
Whoaaaa!

227
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,013
Don't let me die!

228
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:13,431
Just take a deep breath,
Reuben.

229
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:15,641
You're not gonna die!

230
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:16,684
What's your name?

231
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:17,810
My name is...

232
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:20,229
Alexand...

233
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,110
Rick... R-R-Reuben's got
tuberculosis!

234
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:27,278
Oh, great work, Morty.

235
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:29,030
Okay, I'll just
cure it and then...

236
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:31,615
Okay.

237
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,908
Well, I can't cure death.

238
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:34,035
This is bad, Morty.

239
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,161
You're trapped
in a dead man.

240
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:36,704
Listen, if the situation
keeps darkening,

241
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:39,540
do yourself a favor and pop by
Pirates of the Pancreas.

242
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:41,876
Obviously I'm biased,
but I think it's great, Morty.

243
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,003
It's a bunch of
pirates running around a

244
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:46,172
pancreas.

245
00:08:46,256 --> 00:08:47,590
We don't whitewash it,
either, Morty.

246
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,175
I mean, the pirates
are really rapey.

247
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:52,094
The top priority is to get,
you know, you guys out of there,

248
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,221
but I'm just saying, if that
becomes impossible, please,

249
00:08:54,306 --> 00:08:55,848
you gotta treat yourself.

250
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:57,141
Oh, man.

251
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:58,976
W-w-w-what is
that horrible smell?

252
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:00,186
You mean the Panda Express?

253
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:03,105
Kidding. I-I'm kidding.

254
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,442
The body is beginning to
constrict and fill with gas.

255
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,152
We're inside a corpse, my boy.

256
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:10,279
Anatomy Park is doomed.

257
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:11,614
Forget about the park,
doctor!

258
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:12,823
How do we get out?

259
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:14,909
The digestive tract is the
evacuation route.

260
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:16,410
Get it?

261
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:18,621
There's an emergency station in
the colon with a ray that can

262
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,081
enlarge us all.

263
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,582
Everybody, head for the colon!

264
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,710
Now I'm taking orders
from a 12-year-old boy?

265
00:09:24,795 --> 00:09:29,423
Morty, the scar sacs containing
the tuberculosis were sabotaged.

266
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:31,592
This disaster
was an inside job.

267
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,594
Keep your eye on Annie.

268
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:35,763
She was written
up several times

269
00:09:35,847 --> 00:09:38,891
by her manager
at the Churro Stand.

270
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:40,726
Intestines are ahead to the
left, then to the right,

271
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:43,270
then left, et cetera.

272
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:47,775
Hey, just so you know,
I-I-I'm actually 14.

273
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:49,235
So, you know...
what?

274
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:50,778
Not 12.

275
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,238
Okay.

276
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,865
You know, because
he just said I was 12.

277
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,242
Oh.

278
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:57,827
Good for you.

279
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,578
Oof. Ugh. Morty.

280
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:00,913

Then we get to the
large intestine!

288
00:10:25,564 --> 00:10:27,356
Shh!
I hear something.

289
00:10:31,194 --> 00:10:32,403
Don't move.

290
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:36,240
Gonorrhea can't see
us if we don't move.

291
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:39,660
Wait, I was wrong.

292
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:40,786
I was thinking of a T. Rex.

293

296
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:52,631
Yes. Why?

297
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,592
Kid, you're a genius.

298
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:55,676

00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:10,065

This is what you wanted.

Be careful what
you wish for.

313
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:31,253
I'm being punished
for taking your iPad.

314
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,213
What?

315
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:33,714
Jerry, let that stuff go, okay?

00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:35,257
I'm sorry I was
a bitch earlier.

317
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:37,301
Let's just be here.

318
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:39,303
Summer!

319
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:40,304
Ethan?

320
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:41,347
What are you doing here?

321
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,431
I've been texting
you for hours!

322
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:43,641
What the hell?!

323
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:44,642
I don't have my phone!

324
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,185
I'm doing a human holiday!

325
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,979
Well, did you even consider
how that might make me feel?!

326
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:50,231
How you feel?!

327
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:52,566
Why is everything always
happening to you?!

328
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:54,485
Summer, do you
have a boyfriend?

329
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,028
Yeah, do you, Summer?

330
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:56,904
I don't know, Ethan.

331
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:58,113
Do I?!

332
00:11:58,198 --> 00:12:00,991
Jerry, no disrespect,
but you really need to

333
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:02,993
connect more with
your family, man.

334
00:12:04,537 --> 00:12:06,330
I should be able to access the
backup generator to get the

335
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:07,706
growth ray online.

336
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,750
If it works, we'll be
regular-sized in a few minutes.

337
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,877
I just hope Reuben's not in a
room with white carpets

338
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:12,920
or upholstery.

339
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:15,381
What the hell is that?

340
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:16,590
The Sphincter Dam.

341
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,425
We built it when Reuben became
incontinent,

342
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,303
but it was not designed
to hold a corpse load.

343
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:23,305
I've almost got it.

344
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,140
Everybody, move
inside the circle.

345
00:12:26,476 --> 00:12:27,351
Poncho?

346
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:28,644
What is this in your backpack?

347
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:30,980
That's Bubonic plague!

348
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:32,481
What are you doing
with that, Poncho?

349
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:34,400
Everybody, get back!

350
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:35,901
Poncho, you son of a bitch!

351
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:39,280
You released the tuberculosis
so you could steal from me?

352
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:40,698
That's right, baby.

353
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:42,908
A lot of people
would pay top dollar

354
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,868
to decimate the population.

355
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,287
I'll take the highest bidder...

356
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:48,122
Al-Qaeda, North Korea,

357
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:51,333
Republicans, Shriners, balding
men that work out,

358
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:54,336
people on the internet that are
only turned on by cartoons

359
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,046
of Japanese teenagers...

360
00:12:56,131 --> 00:13:00,551
Anything is better than working
for you, you pompous, negligent,

361
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:04,847
iTunes-gift-card-as-a-holiday-
bonus-giving mother...

362
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,600
Come on!

363
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:12,730
Aah!

364
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:13,605
Get off!

365
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:18,277
You guys!

366
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,611
It's gonna burst! Go!

367
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:20,571
Go, go, go!

368
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:24,199
My foot is stuck.

369
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:25,743
No! It's okay!

370
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:27,828
It's okay. Just go.
Tell my family I love them.

371
00:13:27,912 --> 00:13:29,872
They may be hard to find 'cause
my wife kept her last name and

372
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,374
she made the kids take it, too,
so, I-I don't know, you can...

373
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,876
No!

374
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:39,548
Let me ask you a question,
Ethan.

375
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,425
Where's the anger
coming from, man?

376
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:44,178
From Summer being
a total bitch!

377
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:49,099
Where's the anger
coming from?

378
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:52,686
My brother...took me fishing
once...in the bushes...

379
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:55,314
I can't...I can't...

380
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,025
He made me feel like a girl!

381
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:00,402
I... he made me a girl!

382
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:03,572
He didn't make
you anything, man.

383
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:05,449
You are who you are.

384
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,201
She is who she is.

385
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,536
Now, you go to her...brand-new.

386
00:14:09,621 --> 00:14:10,621
Come here, right now.

387
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:11,580
Oh, my God.

388
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:12,915
I'm so sorry, Ethan!

389
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,041
I love you!

390
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:14,958
I love you so much.

391
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,003
Um...

392
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:19,838
You did it again, cubbie.

393
00:14:19,923 --> 00:14:21,006
Come here.

394
00:14:25,553 --> 00:14:27,763
No! Stop! I hate this!

395
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,808
Well, Christmas doesn't revolve
around what you hate, son.

396
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,142
Well, then I hate Christmas!

397
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:33,560
Enjoy being human!

398
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:35,270
You guys are gross and lame.

399
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:37,439
My name's Reuben Ridley.

400
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:40,567
You're inside me right now, but
by the end of this journey...

401
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:41,610
Whoopsie.

402
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,946
I'll be inside all of you.

403
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,948
My story begins during

404
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,367
the dot-com crash
in the early '90s.

405
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:52,079
You can put your fingers
wherever you want.

406
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:54,081
Morty, you want to put it
on mute or something?

407
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:55,499
I'm... I'm trying to
concentrate.

408
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,500
Uh...Rick?

409
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:57,835
Not now, Jerry.

410
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,545
I've got much,
much smaller fish to fry.

411
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,380
I wanted to say I'm sorry
I ever judged you.

412
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:03,632
Right now,
you're my sanest relative.

413
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:05,384
Relative.

414
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:06,593
R-relative size!

415
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:08,387
Jerry, hand me a scalpel
and a bundle of dynamite.

416
00:15:08,471 --> 00:15:09,721
Morty, can you get
to the left nipple?

417
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,056
Are you kidding?

418
00:15:11,141 --> 00:15:12,641
I'm hoping I can get
to both of 'em, Rick.

419
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:14,518
No, Morty, I'm talking about
Reuben's left nipple.

420
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,230
We need to get
to the left nipple!

421
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:19,982
The body is decaying.

422
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,317
The arterial transit
system is useless.

423
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:24,194
We can try the service shuttle.

424
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,737
It's connected to
the skeletal system.

425
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:27,781
That's why we call
it the bone train.

426
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:30,909
Would you like to ride
the bone train, Miss?

427
00:15:30,994 --> 00:15:32,536
If it'll get us out of here.

428
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,121
How about you, Morty?

429
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:37,082
Would you like to
ride the bone train?

430
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,375
Why are you doing this bit?

431
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,085
We're gonna die! Let's go!

432
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:45,090
Well...I can see you're busy.

433
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,508
Merry Christmas, Rick.

434
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:51,388
There's no auto pilot.

435
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:54,600
One of us will have to stay
here and operate it manually.

436
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:01,815
Uh, well...
No, you're... you're right.

437
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,942
I-It was a dick move for me
to even pause like that.

438
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:05,068
This is all my fault.

439
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:06,445
You go on.

440
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,447
What the hell is that?

441
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:09,823
E. Coli outbreak.

442
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:10,741
Hurry!

443
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:15,037
Wait, there is an autopilot.

444
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:16,705
Wait!

445
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:18,290
It's okay! Never mind!

446
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,168
I wanted to sacrifice
myself anyway!

447
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,881
They're... they're chewing
through the doors!

448
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,425
We're in the areola, Rick...

449
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,720
almost to the nipple, but we're
also in a really bad situation!

450
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,472
I'm almost there, Morty!

451
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:45,901
Reports from all over the
country have been coming in

452
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:48,278
about what a ppears
to be a giant,

453
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:51,615
naked man over the
continental United States.

454
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,076
We now go to Tom Randolph
in New York. Tom?

455
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,329
Well, the eyes aren't twinkling
and the dimples aren't merry,

456
00:16:57,413 --> 00:17:01,333
but I'm standing under a
nose like a 70-mile cherry.

457
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,543
Thank you, Tom.

458
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:05,212
Let's go now to Eric McMahan
in Los Angeles.

459
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:07,214
We've got feet here on
the West Coast, Bill...

460
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:08,674
giant feet,

461
00:17:08,758 --> 00:17:10,717
even relative to the
giant man's size,

462
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:13,470
and you know what
they say about that.

463
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:15,556
Well, if the old
adage is true,

464
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,727
one can only wonder what's going
down in the Rocky Mountains.

465
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:22,854
Wha?

466
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,283
Oh my God, the track!

467
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:35,659
It's Hepatitis A!

468
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,202
Aaaah!

469
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:54,136
The nipple hole.

470
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,388
It's beautiful.

471
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:04,146
Oh, no!

472
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,731
Holy crap!

473
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,110
Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!

474
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:16,241
Um...wait...

475
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:18,785
Did we have some sort of
relationship with him?

476
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,287
I think they're
just like that?

477
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:22,164
I think they're
just good guys.

478
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,666
Oh. Huh.

479
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,084
Where's Dr. Bloom?

480
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,711
I'm sorry, Rick,
but he's dead.

481
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:28,837
God damn it, Morty.

482
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,672
I ask you to do one thing!

483
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,309
Jerry doesn't know
what he's missing.

484
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:43,727
He'll come around, Beth.

485
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,312
Christmas is a special time.

486
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,439
It has funny ways of
bringing families together.

487
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:48,857
I don't know, Jacob.

488
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:51,985
Jerry got an invitation to be
alive today, and he rejected it.

489
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,529
I don't know if
our marriage will...

490
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,701
It's raining blood!

491
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:00,911
Oh, shit. Find Jerry.

492
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:01,912
Oh, God.

493
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:03,747
Jerry!
It's all right.

494
00:19:03,831 --> 00:19:05,749
The TV says there's
nothing to worry about.

495
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,669
The giant, naked sky
Santa has exploded.

496
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:12,214
Blood and chunks of viscera are
raining down on the country.

497
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:14,216
Everything should be fine.

498
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:16,343
Oh, yes.

499
00:19:16,427 --> 00:19:17,719
Dad, can I have
my phone back?

500
00:19:17,804 --> 00:19:19,221
A sure, sweetie. Here.

501
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,640
Everybody, take a device.

502
00:19:21,724 --> 00:19:23,266
It'll help you relax.

503
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:24,351
This is nice.

504
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:25,727
Yeah.

505
00:19:25,812 --> 00:19:28,605
Look, I guess we really learned
something this Christmas, Jacob.

506
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,773
No, we didn't, Dad.

507
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,692
No, we didn't.

508
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:34,736
Too bad about Dr. Bloom.

509
00:19:34,821 --> 00:19:35,987
He was a genius...

510
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:38,323
the only man capable of
creating a new Anatomy Park.

511
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,909
Actually, I studied
Dr. Bloom's work.

512
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:43,203
I-I-I-I believe I have the
knowledge necessary to create

513
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:44,996
an entirely new,
much safer park.

514
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,039
What about...

515
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:47,416
Pirates of the Pancreas?

516
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,918
I think it was one of the
most underrated attractions.

517
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,504
Boo-yah!
Hold your breath.

518
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:54,673
Hey, w-w-what the hell,
Rick?!

519
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:56,675
What the hell, man! I liked her!

520
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,635
I really had something
going there, Rick!

521
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,970
Yeah, so I heard.

522
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:01,722
you dodged a bullet,
Morty... trust me.

523
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:03,515
Puffy vagina.

524
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,850
W-what's wrong with that?

525
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:06,393
That doesn't sound
like a problem to me.

526
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:07,644
I don't know.

527
00:20:07,729 --> 00:20:08,812
Come on,
let's get some stuffing.

528
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,272
I'm starving.

529
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:13,567
Oh, unbelievable.

530
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,944
We got... we got a bunch of
robot, computer people,

531
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:18,697
sitting around with their faces
stuffed into computer screens.

532
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,824
Do you guys realize that
Christ was born today?

533
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:24,369
Jesus Christ, our savior,
was born today.

534
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:26,037
Are... are... are
you people even human?

535
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:28,081
What kind of
Christmas is this?

536
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,989
Hey, Rick? Rick, can you hear me?

537
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:01,865
Loud and clear, Annie.

538
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:02,866
Great.

539
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,743
We're also on with Alejandro,
our Chief Imaginarian.

540
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:05,869
Hey, Rick.

541
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,163
Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter
from Microscopic Marketing,

542
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,874
Zack from Organ Concepts,
and Jamie from New Media.

543
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,250
Hey, everybody.

544
00:21:12,335 --> 00:21:13,293
Hi, how's it going? Hi, Rick.

545
00:21:13,377 --> 00:21:14,836
So, Pirates of the Pancreas.

546
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:15,879
Yeah. Talk to me.

547
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:17,422
Hey, Rick.
It's Alejandro speaking.

548
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:20,675
Um, so, we asked ourselves,
internally...

549
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,010
we asked ourselves over here,

550
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:24,012
"Okay, what does
a pancreas do?"

551
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,681
and the answer was,
"Does it make pirates?"

552
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,809
No, it makes insulin,
you know?

553
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:30,560
So, we're starting
with a new...

554
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:33,021
Those guys are
inside me, huh?

555
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:34,773
Like, building a park?

556
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:36,775
Those guys are inside you
building a piece of shit, Ethan!

557
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:38,610
They're inside you building
a monument to compromise!

558
00:21:38,694 --> 00:21:40,320
Fuck 'em.

559
00:21:40,404 --> 00:21:41,363
Fuck those people.

560
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:43,990
Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.

561
00:21:44,075 --> 00:21:45,534
Cool.

562
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:46,451
And who pays me?

563
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:49,830
Did you get any of that?

564
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,748
It's a good-a show!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

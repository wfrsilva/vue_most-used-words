1
00:00:01,315 --> 00:00:03,775
Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:05,485
for a broken
defraculator.

3
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:08,696
That is multiphase quantum
resonator.

4
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:10,532
- Well, does it defraculate?
- Fuck no.

5
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:12,534
Then... then... then
it's a broken defraculator.

6
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:14,536
Like you would even know dick
about fraculation!

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,246
Your planet
just got cellphones,

8
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,331
and the coverage
still sucks!

9
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:20,458
Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur.

10
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,293
So, let's say 60 smidgens.

11
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:24,003
I tell you what...
I'll do you a favor.

12
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:25,588
I'll throw in a fart.

13
00:00:25,673 --> 00:00:27,590
Hey, uh, Rick, um,
you think

14
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,425
maybe I could get
something from this place,

15
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,261
like a souvenir, like,
just to have...

16
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,012
like, something cool,
you know?

17
00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:34,556
Not here, Morty.
We'll stop somewhere else.

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,849
Because, you know, there's
always another pawn shop.

19
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:38,851
Oh, okay. I just, um...

20
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:40,520
you know, I thought that
robot over there

21
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:42,355
looked pretty cool,
you know?

22
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,816
Oh, it looks cool, huh?
That's why you want it?

23
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,442
Yeah!
You know, I mean...

24
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:48,152
it's different
from the stuff on Earth,

25
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:50,154
and, you know, you take me
to all these crazy places

26
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,698
across the galaxy,

27
00:00:51,782 --> 00:00:53,700
and, you know, I don't
really have anything to...

28
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:55,660
to remember all those
trips by.

29
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:57,662
It'd be kind of cool,
like a souvenir.

30
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,414
You know, like, what if
you passed away

31
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:00,790
or died
or something?

32
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,584
I wouldn't even have anything
to remember

33
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:04,377
all the cool stuff
we did, you know?

34
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:06,379
Okay. 60
for the resonator,

35
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:09,132
and my grandson
wants the sex robot.

36
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:49,881
So, we're just going
to pretend this isn't happening?

37
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:51,966
I'm not saying that's
a bad idea... just asking.

38
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:53,801
Rick, why would you
let Morty

39
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:55,928
bring that
thing into our house?!

40
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,388
I don't know.
What do you want from me?

41
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:59,766
He thi... he thou...
he thought it looked cool.

42
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,683
You know what I mean?

43
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:01,934
Whew!

44
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,440
Ahh. All right.

45
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:10,026
Back to... back to...
b-back upstairs.

46
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:15,323
Well, I'm intervening.

47
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:16,991
Intervening with
puberty?

48
00:02:17,076 --> 00:02:19,452
You'll turn him into
Ralph Fiennes in "Red Dragon."

49
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:22,580
He's at that age.
Let's just be proud of him.

50
00:02:22,665 --> 00:02:25,124
Jesus. Did I really set
the bar that low?

51
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,419
Um, Rick, could you
come with me, please...

52
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:29,629
q-quickly?

53
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:33,633
Okay, now if we hear squeaking,
we intervene.

54
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,136
Where's the sex robot,
Morty?

55
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,347
That is Gwendolyn...
I-I mean, the robot!

56
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:41,849
She started beeping, transformed
and tried to fly away!

57
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:43,518
Strange... that's
usually the man's job.

58
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:45,228
You know what I'm talking
about, Morty?

59
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:47,105
Wubba-lubba-dub-dub!

60
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:48,606
Morty!

61
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,274
That's my
catchphrase, remember?

62
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:52,944
Remember... remember how I...
how I cemented that catch phrase?

63
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:54,362
All right.
All right, seriously, though,

64
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:55,571
let me
grab this thing.

65
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,492
Come on, you... rascal.

66
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:02,578
- Okay, unacceptable! Oh.
- What is going on?

67
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:04,414
All right. Uh-oh.

68
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,374
"Uh-oh"? What is that?!

69
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,292
Hmm. I think Morty's robot
was designed

70
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,753
for more than long
weekends.

71
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:14,549
Genetic compiler,
incubation chamber.

72
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,467
Yep. This here's some kind
of baby maker,

73
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:18,177
and that there's half Morty,
half...

74
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:20,179
who... who knows wh-what?

75
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:22,265
It's my bad, guys.
I'll... I'll take care of it.

76
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:23,891
- Grandpa Rick, no, no!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

77
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:25,560
What do you think
you're doing?!

78
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:27,353
Hey, listen... you guys
quarantined the house

79
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:29,105
when Summer brought olives
back from Mexico.

80
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,274
I mean, this thing could grow
to the size of Delaware.

81
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,693
I mean, it might eat brains
and exhale space AIDS.

82
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:35,528
We gotta be careful.

83
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:37,530
I lost the chance
to be careful, Rick.

84
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:38,865
I'm a father now!

85
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:40,742
You know, it's time for me
to be responsible.

86
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:42,577
Isn't that right...
- Don't name it.

87
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:44,579
- ...Morty Jr.?
- Oh, crap. He named it.

88
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,581
Well, Dad, it's a living thing,
and it's half human.

89
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:49,292
And it was born on American
soil, which entitles it to...

90
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,294
Jerry, majoring in
Civics was your mistake.

91
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:52,712
Don't punish us for it.

92
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:54,255
Fine.

93
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:57,049
I'm gonna take this thing
to my workshop and investigate.

94
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,051
Do not let that thing out
of your sight.

95
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:02,054
It looks harmless now,
but it could grow dangerous.

96
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:04,056
Like The Insane Clown Posse.

97
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:06,017
Yeah. Good one, Jerry.

98
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,644
2003 just called.
It wants its easy target back.

99
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:10,813
Ohh.
He's like a little me!

100
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:13,900
Y-You don't think he'll turn
into a monster... do you?

101
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:15,526
They always do.

102
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:17,862
Hey, uh, 1995 called!

103
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,363
They want their
"certain year called

104
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:21,282
wanting its 'blank' back"
formula back!

105
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,326
Why, Jerry?
Why expend the effort?

106
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,578
Life is effort,
and I'll stop when I die!

107
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:29,624
- Out.
- Whatcha doin'?

108
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,417
Well, I can't solve
the problem my way,

109
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:33,419
thanks to your family's
primitive biological hang-ups.

110
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:35,755
Gross. I might have just
touched one of Morty's loads.

111
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,049
But maybe I can find suitable
parents for Morty Jr.

112
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:41,886
on this robot's home world,
which is...

113
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,888
Gazorpazorp
in the Andromeda system.

114
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:46,891
Scoot, Summer.
- Don't you need a new companion

115
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,893
now that Morty's
in the family way?

116
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:51,145
I don't do adventures
with chicks, Summer.

117
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,147
Oh, right... because there's
something about having a wiener

118
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,650
that would make me better
at walking through a hole?

119
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,778
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Oh, crap.

120
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,738
Grandpa Rick! Ugh!

121
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:03,241
Help! Help! Aah! Aah!

122
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:07,829
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

123
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:09,497
- Grandpa Rick!
- Still think it's a good idea

124
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:11,082
to go through holes
without a wiener?

125
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,584
- I want to go home.
- Yeah, no duh.

126
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,044
Ugh!

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,757
Great. Now I have to take
over a whole planet

128
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:22,134
because of your stupid
boobs.

129
00:05:22,219 --> 00:05:24,971
- You're doing great, Morty.
- Really? You think?

130
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:26,806
I mean, I'm not doing
much of anything.

131
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,140
What do I do if it cries?

132
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,351
Then you put it down
and let it cry itself out.

133
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,937
Yeah, right. We tried
that technique on Summer,

134
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:35,147
and she's gonna end up
stripping, isn't she?

135
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:36,649
Yes, she is.

136
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,651
She's gonna strip
for attention

137
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,653
because she was denied it.

138
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:43,072
Stop filling it
with your own insecurity.

139
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:45,241
You're gonna turn it
into Morty...

140
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:47,451
uh, mm... more...
more... more... more of you.

141
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:49,287
Well, we can't all be
raised like reptiles

142
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:51,080
by a mentally ill scientist.

143
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:52,915
What the... aah! Aah!

144
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:57,253
Listen to me. I am not
rewarding this behavior.

145
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:58,921
Knock it off,
both of you!

146
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:00,756
G-Give me him!
Give me my baby!

147
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,550
You're both nuts!

148
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:05,094
I'm gonna raise Morty Jr.
myself!

149
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:07,763
♪ Where's your hands?
There's your hands ♪

150
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:10,391
♪ And that's how we play
handy hands ♪

151
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,936
Oh, you are going
to ruin that kid, Morty.

152
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:15,855
At least we can agree
on that.

153
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,990
Thanks, Dum-Dum.

154
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:28,576
I said, "Thanks, Dum-Dum."
Go get more.

155
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,202
Summer, put your burqa on!

156
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:32,204
That burqa is
a human-rights violation,

157
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,832
and I spent a lot
on this top.

158
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,667
Look, I'm trying to
repair a p-portal gun

159
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,085
with a bunch of sex-doll
parts,

160
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,503
and I have to do it
one-handed

161
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:41,589
to keep these Belushis
from carting you off.

162
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:43,758
The least you could do is be
ashamed of your gender.

163
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:46,218
Ugh. What's the deal
with this place?

164
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:48,012
Why is it such
a sausage planet,

165
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:50,348
and how did such backward
idiots invent robots?

166
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:52,016
Obviously, at some point,

167
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,434
the Gazorpians became
so evolved

168
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:55,978
that they replaced females
with birthing machines.

169
00:06:56,063 --> 00:06:58,189
The resultant lack of
distraction and hen-pecking

170
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:00,149
allowed them to focus entirely
on war,

171
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,151
so they bombed themselves back
to the stone age,

172
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:04,111
and now they just fight with
each other over fake pussy

173
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:05,613
with sticks and rocks
all day long.

174
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:07,782
You think it's efficient
to get rid of women?

175
00:07:07,866 --> 00:07:09,867
You ever see a line for
the men's room?

176
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:11,619
Are you hear... do you li...
do you hear me, Summer?

177
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:14,747
Droppin' loads.

178
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:17,917
Droppin' loads! Droppin' loads.

179
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:22,213
The plot thickens.

180
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:27,051
Uh, you might want to cover
your eyes, Summer.

181
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,178
Yeah, like it was
my dream to watch.

182
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:32,056
Yeah, baby!

183
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,767
Summer, grab...
grab hold.

184
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,143
Yeah, baby!

185
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:37,603
Aaaah!

186
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:42,233
Grandpa Rick, where
are we going?

187
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:43,859
Well, obviously, Summer,

188
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:45,945
it appears the lower
tier of this society

189
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:48,197
is being manipulated through sex
and advanced technology

190
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:50,950
by a hidden ruling class.
Sound familiar?

191
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,910
Ticketmaster.

192
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:54,996
Oh, there... there we
go, Summer.

193
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,747
Hey... hey, brother.
Hey, bro.

194
00:07:56,832 --> 00:07:58,582
Nice racket you got
going on here.

195
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:01,419
Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from
Earth dimension C-137.

196
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:03,671
Don't mean you any harm.
Coming in peace.

197
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:06,549
It's all cool in the, uh...
"good in the neighborhood"

198
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,884
is what I was trying to come...
is what I meant.

199
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,431
Oh, I get it...

200
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,975
the old behind-every-great-man
Amazon twist.

201
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:18,269
Silence!

202
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:23,691
- Your slave is ill-mannered.
- My slave?

203
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:25,693
We assume you are
from a more primitive world,

204
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:27,903
where men are still
permitted to be servants.

205
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,448
If he is a rogue male, tell us
now and we will kill him.

206
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,116
He's my slave.
He's my slave.

207
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,117
He's definitely my slave.

208
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:36,203
Ugh! Ohh! Oh-ho-ho!

209
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,997
Oh, boy.

210
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,915
What's the opposite
of "wubba-lubba-dub-dubs"?

211
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,834
Am I right,
ladies and gentlemen?

212
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:44,253
Are you guys kidding me?

213
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:46,172
Oh, Morty Jr.!

214
00:08:46,256 --> 00:08:48,257
You're gonna be a special
little guy, aren't you?

215
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,426
You... oh, yeah.
You're my special little guy.

216
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,261
Ohh.

217
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,138
Ohh! Ha ha!

218
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:55,139
Da.

219
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:56,724
What was that,
Morty Jr.?

220
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,684
Were you gonna say, "Dada"?
Say, "Dada."

221
00:08:58,769 --> 00:08:59,727
Death!

222
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:01,145
"Dada."

223
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:02,605
Domination!

224
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:04,690
Um... "Dada"?

225
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,692
Destruction. Domination.

226
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:09,153
Nice.

227
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,578
The spider in sector "C" is still alive.

228
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:19,580
Plan your route accordingly
and expect delays.

229
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:21,582
We're not telling you
what to do.

230
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,584
We're just sharing
how we feel.

231
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:25,586
And now weather...
is anyone else cold,

232
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,671
or is it just me?

233
00:09:29,257 --> 00:09:31,759
I am Mar-sha,
ruler of Gazorpazorp.

234
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:33,636
I am here
if you need to talk.

235
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,013
- What is this place?
- Paradise.

236
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,766
We built it during the great
passive-aggression,

237
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,893
when the females separated
from the males

238
00:09:40,977 --> 00:09:43,646
due to their increasingly
destructive behavior.

239
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,147
I am here
if you need to talk.

240
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:47,108
I am here if you need
to talk.

241
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,693
From here, we dispense
mechanical surrogates

242
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:51,195
to maintain our population.

243
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,657
Fertilized surrogates are
returned here to our nursery.

244
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,660
The females are placed
into educational programs

245
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:00,162
where they can discover
a service to our paradise

246
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:02,081
that fulfills them most.

247
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:04,416
Males...

248
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:08,087
...they get to play outside.

249
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,089
That was just a baby.

250
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:12,091
And within a day, he'll be
an adult male Gazorpian...

251
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:14,009
one of the most aggressively
violent creatures

252
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:15,344
in the universe.

253
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:17,346
Wait a minute... we're here
because a male Gazorpian

254
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,807
was born on our planet.

255
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:25,396
You speak when you're
spoken to, ding-a-ling!

256
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,940
It's true, though... one of your
babies was born on Earth.

257
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:30,276
Are you the ruler of this
Earth?

258
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,361
- How did you know?
- The quality of your top.

259
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:34,280
- Do you love it?
- I love it.

260
00:10:34,364 --> 00:10:35,698
I'm here if you need to talk.

261
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:37,116
I'm here if you
need to talk.

262
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,450
I'm here if you need
to talk.

263
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:41,203
If the Gazorpian is male,
your Earth is in grave danger.

264
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:43,038
We will give you passage
back home

265
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,456
so it can be terminated.

266
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,125
But first, mojitos.

267
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:47,960
We don't have time
for mojitos.

268
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:50,337
- You are insulting them.
- I don't care, Summer!

269
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,339
This place is the worst!
I want to go home!

270
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,341
Well, it really
doesn't matter what you want,

271
00:10:54,426 --> 00:10:56,552
because this is a sane place
where women rule.

272
00:10:56,636 --> 00:10:58,554
Yeah. You know what
I have to say about that?

273
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:03,642
I cannot believe my ears!

274
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:10,983
Whoo, boy!
Who let the frogs out, huh?

275
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,068
Grandpa!

276
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:15,279
- Grandpa?
- That sounds patriarchal!

277
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:16,947
It means "father of father."

278
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:19,283
Then this one
is not your slave,

279
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,785
and your Earth is yet
another planet dominated by men.

280
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,996
It's not dominated
by us, okay?

281
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,873
On Earth, men and women
are equals.

282
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:29,376
Equals?! We make 70% of your
salary for the same job!

283
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:31,212
- Seize them!
- Whoa!

284
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:35,382
Was this really the time
to make that point, Summer?

285
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:38,844
This is for you, Daddy.

286
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:40,137
Oh, man!

287
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,306
Um, okay.
Listen to me, Morty Jr.

288
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,975
I've got to tell you something
very important, okay?

289
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,019
Killing is bad...
bad!

290
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:49,021
You're silly, Daddy.

291
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:51,273
No, Morty Jr.
I'm being serious, okay?

292
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:53,108
You need to put your energy
into something else.

293
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:54,860
I mean, what about dancing?

294
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:56,320
Would you like to learn
how to dance?

295
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:59,198
I'd like to dance...
on the graves of my enemies.

296
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:01,742
Ohh!
No, Morty Jr.!

297
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:05,246
Daddy, can I go outside?

298
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,789
No! Absolutely not!

299
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,916
But that's where all
the people and the animals are.

300
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,168
Yeah, but you can't
go out there because the...

301
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:13,170
the air is poisonous
for you!

302
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,546
You will die...
you'll die instantly

303
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,465
if you ever leave
this house!

304
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:17,800
You hear me?
- For real?

305
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,593
For real times
a million, buddy.

306
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:21,053
So, let's just stay inside,

307
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:23,055
and, you know, let's try
dancing, right?

308
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:25,057
Look at me. Yay! Look.
We're gonna dance.

309
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:26,934
Come on. Join...
dance with me here.

310
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:28,727
We love to dance.
- Why do we love to dance?

311
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,230
'Cause I said so!

312
00:12:31,314 --> 00:12:34,066
Nice.

313
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,531
So, what are you in for?

314
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,658
Because I got...
I got a big,

315
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:44,535
you know, penis
between my legs.

316
00:12:44,619 --> 00:12:46,370
What... what...
what are you in for?

317
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:48,747
The worst crime
a female can commit.

318
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:50,374
Veronica Ann Bennett,

319
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,585
I find you guilty of having
bad bangs.

320
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,546
You ever notice the ones
with bad bangs

321
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,256
always have three
names?

322
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,592
You are hereby sentenced
to the silent treatment!

323
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,971
Pfft!
This is gonna be cake.

324
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:05,139
No! Jackie!

325
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:06,807
Rick and Summer of Earth,

326
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:08,976
for the crimes of treason
against womankind

327
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,396
and for creating the sound
of which we do not speak

328
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,982
because it does not exist,
you are hereby sentenced to...

329
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,067
What, what, what...
a night on the couch?

330
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:18,861
- ...death.
- Ooh, gerp.

331
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:20,738
I hate you so much
right now.

332
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:22,740
This will be
the first instance

333
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:24,742
of capital punishment
in our society

334
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:27,411
in 500 years due
to our awesomeness,

335
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:29,455
so we are forced
to improvise.

336
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:32,499
We placed a large boulder
on that ledge.

337
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:35,127
Holy shit! Y-Y-You're gonna
crush us with a boulder?!

338
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:37,129
No! Stop interrupting!

339
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,922
The boulder falls
onto a lever

340
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:40,924
that will launch...
knives.

341
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:42,092
What?

342
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:43,927
Just give me a gun.
I'll kill myself.

343
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,596
Stop interrupting!

344
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,514
The knives will...

345
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,892
Fine! You were right
the first time, okay?

346
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,518
The boulder crushes you.

347
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:53,520
I just didn't want to admit
you were right. Happy?

348
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:55,522
No, just ignore them.
Ignore them.

349
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,191
Such an asshole.

350
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:59,026
Look, I'm sorry, Summer.

351
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,819
I feel bad that I let you
drag us into this.

352
00:14:00,904 --> 00:14:02,696
I wish I could have been
a better Grandpa to you,

353
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:04,365
and, you know,
for what it's worth,

354
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:06,367
that is a really nice, cute top
that you're wearing there.

355
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:08,202
Top. My top!

356
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:11,205
My top... the same top you
complimented earlier!

357
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:14,541
Look... look at the tag.
Read it.

358
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:17,336
It says, "Marc Jacobs."

359
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,464
Marc? Jacob?
These are names of the penis.

360
00:14:20,548 --> 00:14:23,592
Yes.
An Earth man made this top.

361
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:25,386
Maybe on your planet,

362
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,013
separation of the genders is
the right thing to do,

363
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:30,015
but on Earth, a certain
percentage of our males

364
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,600
are born gay,

365
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:35,145
which is why my clothes are
better than all of yours.

366
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,688
A man made something fashionable?

367
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,691
It's true, and sometimes
the truth hurts,

368
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:41,402
but it must be accepted.

369
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,404
Like if I told you that
you're using

370
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:45,239
the wrong
color foundation for your skin

371
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:47,074
and it ends at your neck,

372
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:48,826
making you look like
a party clown.

373
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,120
Okay, ouch. Noted.
But the fact remains...

374
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,997
if you impose
Gazorpazorp's laws on Earth,

375
00:14:54,082 --> 00:14:55,624
you're no better
than the men

376
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,960
whose farts shall remain
unspoken.

377
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,962
And if you think my top
is cute,

378
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:01,964
you cannot execute.

379
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,926
Very well. Give the Earth
people a spacecraft

380
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,928
so they may head back
to their weird planet,

381
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:11,056
where women are kind of equal
but not really.

382
00:15:11,141 --> 00:15:13,058
Good job, Summer,
and thanks, girls.

383
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:14,768
You know, you girls are really
something,

384
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,353
I'll tell you that.

385
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:18,021
You know when we first
go there, I was like...

386
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:19,648
Give them a ship now.

387
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:23,026
Morty Jr.! Smoking?!

388
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:24,528
That is not okay!

389
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:25,821
What are you gonna do...
ground me?

390
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,114
I can't go outside anyway!

391
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,867
So what?!
You could do things inside!

392
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:32,119
You could play guitar.
You could masturbate.

393
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:34,663
I don't want to masturbate.
I want to conquer the planet!

394
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:37,332
Oh, here we go again!
You know, who do you think...

395
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:39,418
is gonna love you if you conquer
the planet, Morty Jr.?!

396
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:41,086
Love... that's all you
care about!

397
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:42,546
What about weapons?!

398
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,423
What about domination
of the enemy?!

399
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,383
All right, that's it...
no more History Channel!

400
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:48,719
This TV is for cartoons
and video games only!

401
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:51,763
I hate video games!
You take that back!

402
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:53,474
Give it to me!

403
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:55,476
Ugh!

404
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,478
I-I-I didn't mean...
I didn't mean that.

405
00:15:57,562 --> 00:15:59,146
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

406
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,648
I can't take this anymore!
I'd rather breathe poison...

407
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,650
than live another minute
with you!

408
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:05,986
No! No, no, no! Stop!

409
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,493
My life has been a lie!

410
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:14,578
God is dead!
The government's lame!

411
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:16,580
Thanksgiving is about
killing Indians!

412
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:18,415
Jesus wasn't born
on Christmas!

413
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,042
They moved the date!
It was a pagan holiday!

414
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:22,044
- Oh, Dad!
- Yes, Morty?

415
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,046
My son is gonna take
over the planet,

416
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,589
and I am too young to drive!

417
00:16:25,673 --> 00:16:26,840
Can you help me
get him back?!

418
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,844
I suppose, Morty.
I suppose.

419
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:34,848
But first, a deep sip
from a very tall glass

420
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:38,018
of "I told you so."

421
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:43,607

00:17:58,891 --> 00:17:59,891
- No!
- Morty!

440
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,685

Dad, I'm so confused!

445
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,327
I know, Morty Jr.
I'm sorry.

446
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:20,120
I ended up lying to you
and yelling at you

447
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:22,164
just like my parents
did to me.

448
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,583
You know, parents are just
kids having kids.

449
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,252
One minute, you like
how a shiny robot looks.

450
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:29,421
The next minute,
you're in a fist fight

451
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:31,340
with your alien son.

452
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:32,841
I'm an alien?

453
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,843
We all have bad
impulses, bad thoughts.

454
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:36,637
We just have to learn
to channel them

455
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:38,347
into something
constructive.

456
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,932
But I want to murder
everyone I see.

457
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:42,768
Well, you know, I mean,
maybe there's a job out there

458
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:44,436
for people that feel
that way.

459
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,937
Actually, there is.

460
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:47,898
Hi. I'm Brad Anderson,
creator of

461
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:50,108
the nationally syndicated
comic strip "Marmaduke."

462
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:52,110
You should consider being
a creative.

463
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:53,820
I'm haunted by uncontrollable
thoughts

464
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:55,572
of mutilation
and sexual assault

465
00:18:55,657 --> 00:18:57,407
on a near daily basis.

466
00:18:57,492 --> 00:18:59,993
But, you know, I channel it
all into my work.

467
00:19:00,078 --> 00:19:01,703
- Oh. Wow.
- Huh.

468
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:03,789
I never got that impression
from reading "Marmaduke."

469
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:05,332
Well, did you get
the impression

470
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,542
I was trying to make
you laugh?

471
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:10,921
Tell me that wasn't
Brad Anderson.

472
00:19:11,005 --> 00:19:13,131
Aw, see?
You hear that, Morty Jr.?

473
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:15,342
Maybe you could try being
a creative of some kind.

474
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,386
Maybe!
I always have sort of wanted

475
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,680
to see my face
on the back of a novel.

476
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:22,683
I mean, what I really want to do
is slit people's throats,

477
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:23,850
but beyond that...

478
00:19:23,935 --> 00:19:26,144
I know you can do it,
son.

479
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:28,563
I think it's time I get
a place of my own.

480
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:31,400
I promise I'll call you
every day I need money

481
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,610
or a place
to do laundry.

482
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:37,656
Aaaaaaah!

483
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:43,370
So, I assume this novel
your son writes

484
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:46,832
is gonna pay for my rear axle?

485
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,542
Isn't it interesting,
Summer,

486
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:50,544
that after all that stuff
we just did,

487
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:52,629
nothing really mattered
and there was no point to it?

488
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:54,673
Kind of makes you wonder,
huh... about nothing?

489
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:57,092
Are you sure it doesn't
make you re-evaluate

490
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,344
your policy about taking
girls on adventures?

491
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,471
No. I'd say, given
what we've been through,

492
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:02,973
that I was right
the whole time

493
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,975
and any epiphanies
about gender politics were

494
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:06,852
a projection of your feminine
insecurity.

495
00:20:06,936 --> 00:20:09,396
But, hey, why don't you have
a pink spaceship?

496
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,481
Go ride around and have
a jolly old time.

497
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:13,692
Maybe that'll shut you up.
- Dad? Summer?

498
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,318
Where were you guys
this whole time?

499
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:16,903
On Gazorpazorp.
Where were you?

500
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:18,530
I was reading
a newspaper.

501
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,991
Oh, that's interesting, Beth.
You know, it's funny.

502
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:23,368
I-I-I heard about a little bit
of news myself.

503
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:25,495
Take a look.
T-Take a listen.

504
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:30,751
Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs!

505
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:32,502
This
this world

506
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:34,671
still got a...
it's still got a chance!

507
00:20:34,756 --> 00:20:36,339
Yeah! Ha ha!

508
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:37,966
See you... see you guys
next week!

509
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,509
See everybody next week.

510
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:10,832
Mortimer Smith, Jr.,

511
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:12,459
New York Times
bestselling author,

512
00:21:12,543 --> 00:21:14,461
your book is about innocence,
the definition of it,

513
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:16,463
and, inevitably,
its impossibility.

514
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:18,298
Is it autobiographical?

515
00:21:18,382 --> 00:21:19,549
Certainly.

516
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:22,469
I mean, all writing is,
in my opinion.

517
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:25,430
But my, uh...

518
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:28,183
My father kept me locked
in the house

519
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,685
until I was a teenager.

520
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,479
And there was violence

521
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:35,607
and, uh,
threats of poison gas...

522
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:37,359
but also dancing.

523
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:39,486
But you persevered
and created this masterpiece

524
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,862
from your suffering.

525
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:43,532
Smith Jr.'s mind-bending novel,
"My Horrible Father",

526
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:45,492
in every store
and on everyone's mind.

527
00:21:45,576 --> 00:21:47,285
Pick it up.
We'll be right back.

528
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,870
It's a thankless job, Morty.

529
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:50,038
You did the best you could.

530
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,541
I hope he's eating enough.

531
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:55,502
Did you get any of that?

532
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:57,587
It's a good-a show!

9999

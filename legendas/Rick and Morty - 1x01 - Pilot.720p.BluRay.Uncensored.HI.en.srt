1
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:04,609
Morty, you got to come on.

2
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:06,152
You got to come with me.

3
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:07,070
What's going on?

4
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:08,071
I got a surprise
for you, Morty.

5
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:08,947
It's the middle
of the night.

6
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,740
I got a surprise for you.

7
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:11,741
Ow!

8
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:13,618
Ow! You're tugging
me too hard.

9
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:14,619
I got a surprise
for you, Morty.

10
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:19,207
What do you
what do you

11
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,209
think of this
flying vehicle, Morty?

12
00:00:21,293 --> 00:00:22,877
I built it out of stuff
I found in the garage.

13
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:24,337
Yeah, Rick, it's...
it's great.

14
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:25,505
Is this the surprise?

15
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,674
Morty, I had to...
I had to do...

16
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:29,342
I had to...
I had to...

17
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:30,343
I had to make a bomb, Morty.

18
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:31,344
I had to create a bomb.

19
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:32,345
What?A bomb?!

20
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:33,680
We're gonna drop
it down there...

21
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:34,639
Just get a whole
fresh start, Morty.

22
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:36,224
Create a whole fresh start.

23
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:37,392
T-t-that's
absolutely crazy!

24
00:00:37,476 --> 00:00:38,518
Come on, Morty.
Just take it easy, Morty.

25
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:40,061
It's gonna be good.

26
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:42,063
Right now, we're gonna go pick
up your little friend Jessica.

27
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:43,147
Jessica?

28
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:44,357
From my math class?

29
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,234
When I drop the bomb,
I don't...

30
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:47,860
You know, I want you to have
somebody,

31
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:49,779
you know...
I want you to have the thing...

32
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:51,114
I'm gonna make it like
a new Adam and Eve,

33
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:52,198
and you're gonna be Adam.

34
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,952
And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and
so that's the surprise, Morty.

35
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:57,120
No, you can't!

36
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:58,538
J-Jessica doesn't
even know I exist.

37
00:00:58,622 --> 00:00:59,789
But... but... but
forget about that,

38
00:00:59,873 --> 00:01:01,416
because you can't
blow up humanity.

39
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,959
I-I get what you're trying
to say, M-Morty.

40
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:04,586
Listen, I'm not...
you don't...

41
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,796
y-y-you don't got to worry about
me trying to fool around with...

42
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,881
with Jessica or mess around
with Jessica or anything.

43
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:10,300
I'm... I'm not that
kind of guy, Morty.

44
00:01:10,384 --> 00:01:11,676
What are you talking
about, Rick?

45
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,261
You... you... you don't
have to worry about me getting

46
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:14,554
with Jessica or anything.

47
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:17,056
She... she... she... she...
she's all for you, Morty.

48
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:19,225
I don't care
about Jessica!

49
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,435
You know what, Morty?
You're right.

50
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,103
Let's forget the
girl all together.

51
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:23,688
She... she's probably nothing
but trouble, anyways.

52
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,189
Arming Neutrino bomb.

53
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:26,107
That's it...
That's it, Rick.

54
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:26,983
I'm taking the wheel.

55
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,234
Get off of me, Morty!

56
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,694
I'm taking charge of
this situation, buddy.

57
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:30,987
What's gotten into you?

58
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:32,405
I'm... I'm... I'm...

59
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,782
I'm not gonna stand around
like some sort of dumb...

60
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:36,117
What are you, crazy?

61
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,577
...person and just let
you blow up the whole world.

62
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:38,494
All right, all right.

63
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,912
I'll... I'll land.

64
00:01:39,997 --> 00:01:40,830
I'll land. I'll land.

65
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:42,707
I'll land the thing.

66
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,208
Big tough guy all of a sudden.

67
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:49,130
We'll park it right here, Morty.

68
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:50,465
Right here on the s-side
of the r-road here.

69
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:51,424
Oh, thank God.

70
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:52,383
You know what?

71
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:54,177
That was all a test, Morty.

72
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,221
Just an elaborate test
to make you more assertive.

73
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:58,181
It was?

74
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,223
Sure. Why not?

75
00:01:59,308 --> 00:02:00,308
I don't... I don't know.

76
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:01,267
You... you know what, Mo...

77
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,811
Neutrino bomb armed.

78
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:06,064
Um...

79
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:44,143
I see there's a new episode of
that singing show tonight.

80
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:47,021
Who do you guys think is
gonna be the best singer?

81
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:48,231
Oh, my God.
His head is in his food.

82
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:49,232
I'm going to puke.

83
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:50,733
Morty, are you getting sick?

84
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:52,902
I told you not to practice-kiss
the living-room pillow.

85
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:54,112
The dog sleeps on it.

86
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:55,863
I wasn't kissing a pillow, Mom.

87
00:02:55,948 --> 00:02:58,366
I just... I didn't get a
lot of sleep last night.

88
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,493
Maybe my dreams were just
too loud or something.

89
00:03:00,577 --> 00:03:02,704
Or maybe you were out all night
again with grandpa Rick.

90
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:03,621
What?

91
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:04,497
Dad?

92
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:06,374
What, so everyone's supposed to
sleep every single night now?

93
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,626
You realize that nighttime
makes up half of all time?

94
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:09,544
Damn it!

95
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:10,795
- Jerry!
- Beth!

96
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,921
Oh, my God.
My parents are so loud.

97
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:12,964
I want to die.

98
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:14,382
Mm, there is
no God, Summer.

99
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:16,259
You got to rip that band-aid off
now. You'll thank me later.

100
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:18,094
Okay, with all due respect,
Rick...

101
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:20,012
What am I talking about?
What respect is due?

102
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:23,683
How is my son supposed to pass
his classes if you keep dragging

103
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:26,394
him off for high-concept
sci-fi rigamarole?

104
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:28,771
Listen, Jerry, I-I don't want to
overstep my bounds or anything.

105
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,398
It's your house.
It's your world.

106
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:31,524
You're a real Julius Caesar.

107
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:32,692
But I'll tell you some...
tell you how...

108
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:33,943
how I feel about
school, Jerry.

109
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:35,278
It's a waste of time...

110
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:36,696
A bunch of people
running around,

111
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,822
bumping into each other.

112
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:39,574
G-guy up front says,
"Two plus two."

113
00:03:39,658 --> 00:03:41,409
The people in the
back say, "Four."

114
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:43,578
Then the bell rings, and they
give you a carton of milk

115
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:46,789
and a piece of paper that says you can
go take a dump or something.

116
00:03:46,874 --> 00:03:49,292
I mean, it's... it's not a
place for smart people, Jerry.

117
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,501
And I know that's not
a popular opinion,

118
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:53,713
but it's my two cents
on the issue.

119
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:55,423
This was a good breakfast,
Beth.

120
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,550
You really made the
crap out of those eggs.

121
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:59,844
I wish your mother
was here to eat them.

122
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:01,220
Oh, Dad.

123
00:04:01,305 --> 00:04:02,096
What?

124
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:04,056
For real?

125
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:05,808
All right, now, everybody get settled.

126
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:07,560
Get away from the windows!

127
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:08,811
Now, look, we're gonna be

128
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,772
dealing with some real
serious stuff today.

129
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:12,732
You might have heard of it.
It's called math.

130
00:04:12,816 --> 00:04:14,859
And without it,
none of us would even exist,

131
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:17,069
so let's jump right in...
two plus two.

132
00:04:17,154 --> 00:04:18,154
Jessica.

133
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,614
Five plus five.

134
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:20,907
Tenssica.

135
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:21,908
Okay, good.

136
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:23,075
It's time for the quiz.

137
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:25,453
Yeah, you know what?!
Aw, too bad!

138
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:26,579
Tough!

139
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:28,831
First row, take one.
Pass it back for me.

140
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,708
The stakes are high
in this room.

141
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:34,045
There's crucial things
happening here every day.

142
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:35,004
People getting smarter.

143
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,130
Some of y'all getting dumber.

144
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:38,466
Some of y'all ain't
gonna see 3:00.

145
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,969
Hi, Morty.

146
00:04:42,054 --> 00:04:43,012
Whoa!

147
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,180
Hi, Jessica.

148
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,598
Can I show these to you?

149
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:46,557
Wow.

150
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:47,725
Th-they're both great.

151
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,726
Thank you.

152
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:49,769
You know what I named these?

153
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:51,062
My little Morties.

154
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,940
Uh, that's flattering...
and a little weird.

155
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:55,983
Do you know what I want
you to do with them?

156
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,026
Rename them?

157
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,486
Squeeze them.

158
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,654
Manhandle them.

159
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:00,780
Give them the business.

160
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,240
See if you can shuffle them.

161
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:04,534
I mean, really get in there
and knock them around.

162
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:05,785
No wrong answers.

163
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:06,661
Wow.

164
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:08,037
Well, okay, Jessica.

165
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:09,497
L-let's give this a shot.

166
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:10,748
Mm.

167
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,833
Oh, Morty.

168
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:13,376
What are you doing to me?

169
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,628
Uh, I-I'm just
doing my best.

170
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:16,671
Morty!

171
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:17,588
What are you doing to me?!

172
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:18,506
Jessica.

173
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,632
Morty!

174
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:21,717
Jessica.

175
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,761
Five more minutes of this,
and I'm gonna get mad.

176
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:25,721
Je-Jessica.

177
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:27,014
Jessica.

178
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:28,266
Not my fault
this is happening.

179
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:32,395
Well, well, well.

180
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,396
Uh, morning, Frank.

181
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,522
"Morning"?

182
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:35,523
What was... what is
that supposed to mean?

183
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:36,732
You making fun of me?

184
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:37,942
Are you trying to
say my family's poor?

185
00:05:38,026 --> 00:05:39,068
Oh, geez, Frank.

186
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:40,486
I don't know if a
knife is necessary.

187
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:42,905
I mean, you know, y-you kind of
had things handled without it.

188
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,241
You telling me
how to bully now?

189
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:46,701
Big mistake, Morty.

190
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:51,038
And now I'm gonna cut you,
'cause my family's rich.

191
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,000
There you are, Morty.

192
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,251
Listen to me.

193
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,961
I got an errand to run in a
whole different dimension.

194
00:05:57,045 --> 00:05:58,546
I need an extra pair of hands.

195
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,755
Oh, geez, Rick.

196
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,173
W-what'd you do to Frank?

197
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,633
It's pretty obvious, Morty.
I froze him.

198
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:04,552
Now listen...
I need your help, Morty.

199
00:06:04,636 --> 00:06:06,178
I mean, we got...
we got to get...

200
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:08,222
get the hell out of here
and go take care of business.

201
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:11,350
It's important. Come on, Morty.

202
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:12,393
I don't know, Rick.

203
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:13,686
I-I can't leave school again.

204
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,146
Do you have any concept of how
much higher the stakes

205
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,439
get out there, Morty?

206
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,940
What do you think...
I can just do it all by myself?

207
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:18,900
Come on!

208
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:20,026
Aw, geez. Okay.

209
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,402
I guess I can skip History.

210
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:22,945
What about Frank?

211
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,113
I mean, shouldn't
you unfreeze him?

212
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:25,406
I'll do it later, Morty.

213
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,449
He'll be fine.

214
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,327
Let's go.

215
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:31,329
Oh, my God.

216
00:06:31,413 --> 00:06:33,873
I'm about to walk
past Frank Palicky.

217
00:06:33,957 --> 00:06:37,043
This is the story we'll
be telling our children.

218
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:38,336
Hi, Frank.

219
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,632
Aah!

220
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:47,219
Scalpel.

221
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:48,429
Knock, knock.

222
00:06:48,513 --> 00:06:49,597
Jerry?

223
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,682
My manager gave me an hour
for lunch, and I thought,

224
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:54,060
"Hey, why not swing by
where your wife works? "

225
00:06:54,144 --> 00:06:55,770
We're losing him.

226
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:57,146
Okay, he's back.

227
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,607
Jerry, please tell me you're
here for an incredibly urgent reason.

228
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,150
Well, it's lunch.

229
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:04,028
I mean, it's one of three meals
that have existed for millennia.

230
00:07:04,112 --> 00:07:05,154
Losing him.

231
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,405
Stabilized.

232
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,950
Okay, I only ask, Jerry,
because, as you know,

233
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:11,494
my job involves
performing heart surgery.

234
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:12,912
Well, yeah, on horses.

235
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,038
Excuse me?

236
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:15,831
Okay. Let's not
rehash thatfight.

237
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,668
I sense that you're busy
and will now be on my way.

238
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:19,835
Whoa!

239
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,420
What is this on the floor?

240
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:24,966
Some kind of literature for
a really nice-looking nursing home.

241
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,717
Hey, honey, crazy idea...
bad pitch...

242
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,177
let's put your Dad here.

243
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,637
Let's put your Dad
in a nursing home.

244
00:07:30,722 --> 00:07:31,639
We're losing him.

245
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:32,640
Hey, Tom.

246
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:33,683
We know when
we're losing him.

247
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:35,059
We can hear the beeps!

248
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:37,269
There she is. All right.

249
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:38,562
Come on, Morty.
Let's go.

250
00:07:38,647 --> 00:07:39,522
Oh, geez.

251
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:40,856
Okay.

252
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:43,651
Oh, man, Rick.

253
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,027
What is this place?

254
00:07:45,112 --> 00:07:47,738
It's dimension 35C,
and it's got the perfect

255
00:07:47,823 --> 00:07:50,783
climate conditions for a
special type of tree, Morty,

256
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:52,159
called a Mega tree,

257
00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:53,536
and there's fruit
in those trees,

258
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,079
and there's seeds
in those fruits.

259
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:56,539
I'm talking about
Mega seeds.

260
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,833
They're... they're
incredibly powerful,

261
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:01,002
and I need them to help me
with my research, Morty.

262
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,004
Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking
around this place,

263
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,839
and I'm starting to work up some
anxiety about this whole thing.

264
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:05,923
All right. All right.
Calm down.

265
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:07,133
Listen to me, Morty.

266
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:09,427
I know that new situations
can be intimidating.

267
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,804
You're looking around, and it's
all scary and different, but,

268
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:14,682
you know, m-meeting them head
on, charging right into them

269
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,934
like a bull...
that's how we grow as people.

270
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:18,769
I'm no stranger
to scary situations.

271
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:20,229
I deal with them
all the time.

272
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,481
Now, if you just stick with me,
Morty, we're gonna be...

273
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:23,983
Holy crap, Morty, run!

274
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:27,111
I never seen that thing
before in my life.

275
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:28,612
I don't even know
what the hell it is!

276
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:29,947
We got to get out
of here, Morty!

277
00:08:30,032 --> 00:08:30,906
It's gonna kill us!

278
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:31,991
We're gonna die!

279
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,242
We're gonna die, Morty!

280
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:37,163
Oh, Morty,
take a deep breath.

281
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:39,248
Breathe that... breathe that
fresh air in, Morty.

282
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:40,541
Y-you smell that?

283
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,168
That's the smell
of adventure, Morty.

284
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:44,587
That's... that's the smell of...
of... of... of a whole different

285
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:46,672
evolutionary timeline.

286
00:08:46,757 --> 00:08:47,840
All right, Rick, look...

287
00:08:47,924 --> 00:08:49,258
how much longer
is this gonna be?

288
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,551
Shouldn't I be
back at school by now?

289
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:51,761
Are you joking me?

290
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:54,263
I mean, look at all the
crazy crap surrounding us.

291
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:55,473
Look at that thing right there.

292
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:56,932
W-what the hell is that thing?

293
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:58,601
You think you're gonna see
that kind of thing at school?

294
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,269
Look at it just
lumbering around.

295
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,938
It defies all logic...
that thing.

296
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:04,023
Yeah, Rick, I get it.

297
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:05,524
We're surrounded by monsters.

298
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:07,401
That's kind of the reason
why I want to leave.

299
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,319
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

300
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:11,530
Morty, you see this?

301
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,574
You see what we just
stumbled upon, Morty?

302
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:14,784
Any idea what that
is down there?

303
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:15,951
The Mega trees?

304
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:17,328
That's right, Morty...
the Mega trees

305
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:18,746
with the Mega fruit on them.

306
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,206
And that's what I'm
talking about, Morty.

307
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,665
That's where my seeds are.

308
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,792
If we would have done
what you wanted,

309
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,126
I would have never
have found them,

310
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:25,878
because y... because you're
so in love with school.

311
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:27,213
All right, all right.

312
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:29,131
So, what's so special about
these seeds, anyways?

313
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,883
You ask a lot of
questions, Morty.

314
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,218
Not very charismatic.

315
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:33,677
It makes you kind of
an under...

316
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:35,179
underfoot figure.

317
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:36,430
Just take these shoes, Morty.

318
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:38,265
They're sp...
special grappling shoes.

319
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,601
When you're wearing these
things... ba... these babies,

320
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,312
you can basically just walk on
any surface you want, Morty...

321
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:45,314
up, down, below,
turn around to the left.

322
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,233
These things really bring
it all together.

323
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:48,943
Aah!

324
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:50,194
You have to turn
them on, Morty!

325
00:09:51,238 --> 00:09:52,488
The shoes have
to be turned on!

326
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:55,324
I am not putting my father in a home!

327
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,284
He just came back
into my life,

328
00:09:57,369 --> 00:10:00,788
and you want to grab him and
stuff him under a mattress like

329
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:02,331
last month's Victoria's Secret?

330
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,875
I told you... I was ordering you
something for Valentine's Day.

331
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,630
More importantly, your father is
a horrible influence on our son.

332
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:10,965
Everything cool in here, Beth?

333
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:11,882
It's fine, Davin.

334
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:13,008
Okay, cool.

335
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:14,510
You know, we did
something great today.

336
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:18,097
There's nothing more noble and
free than the heart of a horse.

337
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:20,599
Since we're fighting,
if you ever have an affair

338
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:22,184
with that guy, I will
come to the hotel room

339
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,728
and blow my brains out
all over your naked bodies.

340
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:27,773
Look, I appreciate the
stress you're under, but

341
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:30,151
Morty was having trouble in
school way before my dad moved

342
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:33,529
in, and the only influence I
can see Rick having is that,

343
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:36,740
for the first time in his life,
Morty has a friend.

344
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:40,786
Well, maybe you're right.

345
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:42,872
Uh, yeah, maybe I am.

346
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:43,873
I'm my father's daughter.

347
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:44,957
I'm smart.

348
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:45,916
Why do you think
I'm a heart surgeon?

349
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:46,834
Horse heart surgeon.

350
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,252
- Hello?
- Mrs. Smith?

351
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:49,879
This is Principal Vagina...
no relation.

352
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,714
I wonder if you and Morty's
father might be able to have

353
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:52,882
a chat with me
this afternoon?

354
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:58,137
Morty, oh, you really d-did a
number on your legs right now.

355
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:00,681
You know, you got to
turn the shoes on, Morty,

356
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:01,932
for them to work.

357
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:03,142
Yeah, look...
I turned mine on.

358
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:04,476
I had no problem
getting down here.

359
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,061
It was a leisurely breeze.

360
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:07,396
I'm in a lot of pain, Rick.

361
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,898
Yeah, I can see that.

362
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:11,817
But do you think you'll still be
able to help me collect

363
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:13,110
my seeds, Morty?

364
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:14,111
Are you kidding me?!

365
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:15,112
That's it, Rick!

366
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:16,447
That's the last straw!

367
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,407
I can't believe this...
I'm sitting here with both

368
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,159
of my legs broken,
and you're still asking me

369
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:21,785
about getting those seeds?!

370
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,329
Ooh! Ow! Oh!

371
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:24,705
Y-y-you're a monster.

372
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,457
Y-you're like Hitler, but...

373
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,584
but even Hitler cared about
Germany or something.

374
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,294
Okay, hold on just a second,
Morty.

375
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:41,764
Ooh.

376
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:45,392
Ohh.

377
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:51,482
Ooh.

378
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:53,734
Wow, Rick.

379
00:11:53,818 --> 00:11:56,278
That stuff just healed
my broken legs instantly.

380
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:59,573
I mean, I've never felt
so good in my life.

381
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:00,574
Thank you.

382
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:01,909
Don't worry about it, Morty.

383
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:03,869
Just come help me get these
seeds, all right, buddy?

384
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:05,120
Sure thing, Rick.

385
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:06,705
Not that you asked, Morty,
but what just happened

386
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,667
there is I went into a future
dimension with such advanced

387
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:11,961
medicine that they had
broken-leg serum at every

388
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,337
corner drugstore.

389
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:14,588
The stuff was all over
the place, Morty.

390
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:16,173
Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.

391
00:12:16,258 --> 00:12:17,591
There's just one problem,
Morty...

392
00:12:17,676 --> 00:12:18,801
one little hang-up.

393
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:20,469
The dimension I visited was so
advanced,

394
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,680
they had also halted
the aging process,

395
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:24,181
and everyone there was young,
Morty,

396
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,391
and they
had been forever.

397
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:27,059
I was the only old
person there, Morty.

398
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:29,270
It was like I was some
sort of, you know, celebrity,

399
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:30,521
walking around.

400
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:31,981
I-I was fascinating to them.

401
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,316
There were a lot of attractive
women there, Morty, and they...

402
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:35,985
they... they...
they all wanted time with me.

403
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,820
I had a lot of fun with
a lot of young ladies,

404
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,488
but I spent so
much time there,

405
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:40,948
my interdimensional
portal device...

406
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:42,658
it's got no charge left, Morty.

407
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:43,701
It's got no charge left.

408
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:44,618
What?!

409
00:12:44,703 --> 00:12:45,786
It's as good as
garbage, Morty.

410
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,829
It's not gonna
work anymore, Morty.

411
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:47,997
Oh, geez, Rick,
that's not good.

412
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,707
W-what are we gonna do?

413
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,875
I-I have to be back
at school right now.

414
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,168
How are we gonna
get back home?

415
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:54,795
There's ways to
get back home, Morty.

416
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,755
It's just... it's just gonna
be a little bit of a hassle.

417
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,590
We're gonna have to go through
Interdimensional Customs,

418
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:01,093
so you're gonna have
to do me a real solid.

419
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:02,094
Uh-oh.

420
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:03,429
When we get to Customs,

421
00:13:03,513 --> 00:13:05,514
I'm gonna need you to take
these seeds into the bathroom,

422
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:07,057
and I'm gonna need you
to put them way up

423
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:08,058
inside your butthole, Morty.

424
00:13:08,143 --> 00:13:09,351
In my butt?

425
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:11,061
Put them way up inside there,
as far as they can fit.

426
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:12,271
Oh, geez, Rick.

427
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:13,564
I really don't want
to have to do that.

428
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:15,107
Well, somebody's got
to do it, Morty.

429
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:18,110
Th-these seeds aren't gonna get
through Customs unless they're

430
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,153
in someone's rectum, Morty.

431
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:21,405
And they'll fall
right out of mine.

432
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,073
I've done this
too many times, Morty.

433
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:24,283
I mean, you're young.

434
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:26,201
You've got your whole
life ahead of you,

435
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:28,454
and your anal cavity is
still taut, yet malleable.

436
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:29,872
You got to do it
for Grandpa, Morty.

437
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:31,707
Y-you've got to put these
seeds inside your butt.

438
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,583
In my butt?

439
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,500
Come on, Morty.

440
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:34,418
Please, Morty.

441
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:35,544
You have to do it, Morty.

442
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:36,545
Oh, man.

443
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:40,341
The fact is, your son, Morty,
has attended this school for a

444
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:42,801
total of seven hours over
the last two months.

445
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:44,428
What? Why didn't
you notify us?

446
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:46,305
I done been notifying you.

447
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,681
Have you not been
getting the messages

448
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:49,099
I've been leaving with Morty's
grandfather?

449
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:50,267
Boom!

450
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:51,894
Told you! In your face!

451
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,771
He is ruining our child!

452
00:13:53,855 --> 00:13:55,272
Wait, what am I celebrating?

453
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:56,982
Yeah, see, I thought
something was fishy there,

454
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,442
because it's usually Morty's
grandpa that's taking

455
00:13:58,526 --> 00:13:59,318
him out of school.

456
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:00,319
Summer?

457
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:03,739
What kind of God lets this happen?

458
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:04,907
We had a little incident.

459
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,617
A student was
frozen to death.

460
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,745
And there's no evidence that
a Latino student did it!

461
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:11,413
Everyone wants to take
this to a racial place.

462
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:12,915
I won't let them.

463
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,960
The Glarp Zone is for flarping
and unglarping only.

464
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,963
So, I told him,
"Give me the Blimfarx," you know?

465
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:21,548
This... this guy...

466
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:22,925
he doesn't understand
interstellar currency.

467
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,718
It's, like, I'm trying
to eat a Flimflam...

468
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:26,887
like, that's what
we eat on Girvonesk.

469
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:29,765
The glarp zone is for
flarping and unglarping only.

470
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,058
I don't like it here, Morty.

471
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:32,393
I can't abide bureaucracy.

472
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:34,186
I don't like being told
where to go and what to do.

473
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,604
I consider it a violation.

474
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:37,189
Did you get those seeds
all the way up your butt?

475
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:38,315
Yeah, Rick.

476
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,691
Let's just get
this over with, okay?

477
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:41,360
I mean, these things are pointy.
They hurt.

478
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:42,611
That means they're
good ones.

479
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,071
You're a good kid, Morty.

480
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:46,365
Those Mega seeds are super
valuable to my work.

481
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:48,117
You've been a huge help to me.

482
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:50,577
I'm gonna be able to do
all kinds of things with them.

483
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,496
It's gonna be great, Morty.

484
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,705
All kinds of science.

485
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,082
Okay, next through.

486
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,959
Except you. You go over there.

487
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:58,085
Why does he have
to go over there?

488
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,211
Random check.

489
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:00,295
He's got to go through
the new machine.

490
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,380
What new...
what new machine?

491
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:02,506
It's a new machine.

492
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,882
It detects stuff all
the way up your butt.

493
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:05,634
Run, Morty! Run!

494
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:06,802
Aah!

495
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:07,803
Red alert!

496
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,067
Ohhhhh!

497
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:31,827
Hey! Ohhhhhh.

498
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:33,704
Aah!

499
00:15:33,788 --> 00:15:34,830
Don't think about it!

500
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,500
Ooh!

501
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:42,212
Oh, nice, Morty!

502
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:43,547
The student becomes
the teacher.

503
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:53,474
Whoooooo!

504
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:56,018
Aah!

505
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:57,686
Aw, hell, no, dawg.

506
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,979
You know me...
I'm just trying to...

507
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:01,231
Aah!

508
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,153
I need to type in the coordinates
to our home world, Morty.

509
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:07,696
Cover me.
- Oh, man.

510
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,698
I mean, you know, I-I
don't want to shoot nobody.

511
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:10,866
They're just robots, Morty!

512
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,034
It's okay to shoot them!

513
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,118
They're robots!

514
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,162
Aah!

515
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:16,580
My leg is shot off!

516
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:17,998
Glenn's bleeding to death!

517
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:20,167
Someone call his wife
and children!

518
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:21,293
They're not robots, Rick!

519
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:22,628
It's a figure of
speech, Morty.

520
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:23,670
They're bureaucrats.

521
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:24,713
I don't respect them.

522
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:25,964
Just keep shooting, Morty.

523
00:16:26,049 --> 00:16:28,634
You have no idea what
prison is like here!

524
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:33,055
Holy crap!
This is insane!

525
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,358
Come on, Morty!

526
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:45,734
We got to get the
hell out of here!

527
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,281
Wow.

528
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:53,700
Did you just come into the
cafeteria through a portal?

529
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:55,077
Uh, yeah.

530
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:57,871
Well, you know, my... my
Ferrari's in the shop.

531
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:00,290
Ju... just kidding.

532
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,959
You're Morty, right?
- Yeah.

533
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:03,126
You can get
his number later.

534
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:04,920
Come on, Morty. We got
to get out of here.

535
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,213
You got to get those
seeds out of your ass.

536
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:07,339
Oh, look, honey.

537
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:09,633
It's our son with
Albert Ein-douche.

538
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:10,801
What?

539
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,302
I'm an angry father,
not an improvisor.

540
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:13,595
Oh, hi, Jerry.

541
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,264
Oh, my goodness, Morty!

542
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:16,932
What are you
doing out of class?

543
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,225
We talked about this.

544
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,102
Your... your parents and
I are very disappointed in...

545
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:22,771
in this behavior.

546
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:24,648
No? No takers?

547
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:26,817
You guys should really not
be touching that stuff.

548
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:27,859
It's beyond your reasoning.

549
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:28,860
You're beyond our reasoning!

550
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:30,237
Takes one to know one.

551
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:34,741
Dad, how could you make my
son miss an entire semester of school?

552
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:36,243
I mean, it's not like
he's a hot girl.

553
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:38,287
He can't just bail on
his life and set up shop

554
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:39,538
in someone else's.

555
00:17:39,622 --> 00:17:40,789
What... what are you
guys doing with my stuff?

556
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:43,542
We're moving you...
to a nursing home.

557
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:44,543
A nursing home?

558
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:45,669
What are...
what are you, nuts?

559
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:46,712
I'm a genius.

560
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:48,130
I build robots for fun.

561
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:50,215
Well, now you can build baskets
and watch Paul Newman movies

562
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,594
on VHS and mentally scar the
Boy Scouts every Christmas.

563
00:17:53,678 --> 00:17:54,511
What does that mean?

564
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:55,429
It's personal.

565
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:56,763
Dad, mom, c-come on.

566
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:59,099
Rick just needed
my help is all.

567
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:00,475
Morty, stay out of this.

568
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,187
You are obviously not capable
of judging these situations on your own.

569
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:05,439
What are you trying
to say about Morty?

570
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:06,523
That he's stupid
or something?

571
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:07,899
Oh, don't high-road us, Dad.

572
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:10,986
You know fully well that Morty
is the last child that needs to

573
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,279
be missing classes.

574
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,197
I-I-I don't know what
you mean by that.

575
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:15,824
Can... can... can you be a
little bit more specific?

576
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,117
Oh, for crying out...

577
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:18,869
he's got some kind of
disability or something.

578
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:20,287
Is that what you
want us to say?

579
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,788
I do?

580
00:18:21,873 --> 00:18:23,540
Well, duh doy, son.

581
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:27,252
Look, I love you, Morty, but we
both know you're not as fast as

582
00:18:27,337 --> 00:18:29,379
the other kids, and if you
want to compete in this world,

583
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:31,298
you got to work
twice as hard.

584
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:32,716
Aw, geez, Dad.

585
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,594
Y-you know, that's a lot
to drop on a kid all at once.

586
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:38,180
Morty, t-tell your parents
the square root of Pi.

587
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:39,598
Oh, come on, Rick.

588
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:40,641
You know I can't.

589
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:41,767
The square root of Pi,
Morty... go.

590
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,895
1.77245385.

591
00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:46,313
Whoa!

592
00:18:46,397 --> 00:18:47,689
What the hell?

593
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:49,316
Holy crap. He's right.

594
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,318
Morty, tell your parents
the first Law of

595
00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:52,694
Thermodynamics.

596
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:55,864
"The increment in the internal
energy of a system is equal to

597
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:57,616
the increment of heat
supplied to the system."

598
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,451
Wow! I'm so smart!

599
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:00,786
But...

600
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,745
I told the both of you...

601
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:02,704
school is stupid.

602
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:03,997
It's not how you learn things.

603
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:05,207
Morty's a gifted child.

604
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,667
He has a special mind.

605
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:07,918
That's why he's
my little helper.

606
00:19:08,002 --> 00:19:09,461
He's like me.

607
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:12,214
He's gonna be doing great
science stuff later in his life.

608
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:13,632
He's too smart for school.

609
00:19:13,716 --> 00:19:16,843
H-he needs to keep hanging out
and helping me.

610
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:19,763
Jerry, I don't want whatever's
happening here to stop.

611
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:21,306
No, I-I understand.

612
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,350
Uh, maybe we overreacted.

613
00:19:23,434 --> 00:19:26,103
But he has to keep
going to school.

614
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:27,479
Okay, Jerry.

615
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:28,897
You drive a hard bargain,

616
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,315
but what am
I supposed to do?

617
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,817
Say... say no?

618
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:33,902
You... you really wear
the pants around here.

619
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:35,779
I just want you to know,
between us, from now on,

620
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:38,156
it's gonna be 100%
honesty and open,

621
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,491
clear communication.

622
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,868
Frank Palicky was
frozen to death today!

623
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:42,911
No idea what you're
talking about.

624
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:45,247
Okay.

625
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,791
Well, uh, Morty,
it's your bedtime in an hour.

626
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,418
Don't stay up
all night again.

627
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:50,794
This is good, though.

628
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:52,170
This can work.

629
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,256
I think we can be a family.

630
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,717
And now, Beth,
if you'll have me,

631
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:58,677
I would love to have you.

632
00:19:58,761 --> 00:19:59,845
You know what?

633
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:01,179
Okay.

634
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,973
Holy cow, Rick.

635
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:05,434
I didn't know hanging out with
you was making me smarter.

636
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,436
Full disclosure, Morty...
it's not.

637
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,480
Temporary superintelligence is
just a side effect of the

638
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:12,274
Mega seeds dissolving in
your rectal cavity.

639
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,567
Aw, man.

640
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:16,027
Yeah, and once those
seeds wear off,

641
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:17,821
you're gonna lose most
of your motor skills,

642
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:20,782
and you're also gonna lose
a significant amount of

643
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:22,200
brain functionality
for 72 hours, Morty.

644
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:24,870
Starting
right about now.

645
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:25,912
Ohh, man.

646
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:28,206
Oh, geez! Ohh.

647
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,250
I'm sorry, Morty.
It's a bummer.

648
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,043
In reality, you're
as dumb as they come.

649
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,837
And I needed those
seeds real bad,

650
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,047
and I had to give them up just
to get your parents off my back,

651
00:20:36,132 --> 00:20:38,049
so now we're gonna
have to go get more.

652
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:39,843
And then we're gonna go on even
more adventures after that,

653
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:41,178
Morty.

654
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,054
And you're gonna keep your mouth
shut about it, Morty,

655
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:45,015
because the world is full of
idiots that don't understand

656
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,183
what's important,

657
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:47,559
and they'll tear us apart,
Morty.

658
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:50,228
But if you stick with me, I'm
gonna accomplish great things,

659
00:20:50,313 --> 00:20:52,314
Morty, and you're gonna be
part of them, and together,

660
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:53,607
we're gonna run around, Morty.

661
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:55,275
We're gonna do all kinds of
wonderful things, Morty.

662
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,276
Just you and me, Morty.

663
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Oh, no, no.

664
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:58,779
The outside world
is our enemy, Morty.

665
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:01,323
We're the only
friends we've got, Morty.

666
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:02,574
It's just Rick and Morty...

667
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:04,826
Rick and Morty
and their adventures, Morty.

668
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:06,620
Rick and Morty forever
and forever.

669
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:08,497
100 years,
Rick and Morty's things.

670
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:11,792
Me and Rick and Morty running
around, and Rick and Morty time.

671
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:14,211
All day long, forever.

672
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:15,837
All... a hundred days.

673
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:17,756
Rick and Morty forever...
100 times.

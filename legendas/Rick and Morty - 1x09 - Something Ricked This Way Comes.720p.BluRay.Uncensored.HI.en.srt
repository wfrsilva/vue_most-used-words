1
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:06,277
Hey, Rick.

2
00:00:06,362 --> 00:00:08,279
I have to make a project for
the science fair this weekend.

3
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:09,948
You think you could
help me out?

4
00:00:10,032 --> 00:00:11,741
- Whatever.
- Well, I mean, traditionally...

5
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:14,202
science fairs are
a father-son thing.

6
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:17,080
Well, scientifically,
traditions are an idiot thing.

7
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:18,665
Morty, I think it would
be fun for you

8
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:21,501
to work on a science project
with your Dad.

9
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,463
Uh...

10
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:28,216
Yeah, Dad.
Why don't we do it together?

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,094
Yes! You backed the right horse
on this one, son.

12
00:00:31,178 --> 00:00:33,304
We'll get out the crayons,
brew some coffee,

13
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,723
and knock this thing out
in two or three days.

14
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:38,643
What is my purpose?

15
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:40,895
Pass the butter.

16
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:43,982
Thank you.

17
00:00:46,902 --> 00:00:48,361
Dad, I need a ride
to work.

18
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:50,238
Maybe Rick can give
you a ride.

19
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:52,115
I'm helping Morty
with science.

20
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,117
- I'm busy.
- Doing what?

21
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:56,661
Uh, anything else.

22
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:58,663
What is my purpose?

23
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:00,790
You pass butter.

24
00:01:00,874 --> 00:01:02,500
Oh, my god.

25
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:04,544
Yeah, welcome
to the club, pal.

26
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:40,413
Since when do you have
a job?

27
00:01:40,497 --> 00:01:41,414
Since last week.

28
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:43,249
It's part-time at this
little vintage thrift store.

29
00:01:43,334 --> 00:01:45,668
My boss is this really
smart, eccentric old man

30
00:01:45,753 --> 00:01:47,962
that treats me nice
and values me.

31
00:01:48,047 --> 00:01:49,839
Meow.
Can't wait to meet...

32
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,716
this
fascinating character.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,344
Please don't.

34
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:57,221
Oh. Well, when did this
stop being Jamba Juice?

35
00:01:57,306 --> 00:01:59,474
I've just recently opened
for business,

36
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,643
Mister, um, Goldenfold.

37
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:03,019
You know my name?

38
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:04,812
That's disarming.

39
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:07,649
I also know you long
for female company.

40
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:10,777
You know, it has been
lonely since the divorce.

41
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:13,696
Some voids can't be filled
with Jamba Juice.

42
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:17,283
This aftershave makes a
man quite irresistible to women.

43
00:02:17,368 --> 00:02:18,743
Free of charge.

44
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:21,454
One never pays here...
not with money.

45
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:23,456
Nothing to read into
there. Thanks!

46
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,500
Sorry I'm late,
Mr. Needful.

47
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:28,753
This is my grandpa, Rick.
He was just leaving.

48
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:29,879
Huh.

49
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:31,756
Tell me, Rick,
what do you desire?

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,758
Eh, I make my own stuff.

51
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:35,635
So, what are you...
like, the devil?

52
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,303
- What? Sorry?
- I don't know.

53
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:40,515
Store comes out of nowhere,
all the shit's old and creepy.

54
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,475
Are you the devil?
A demon? Leprechaun?

55
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,352
- Grandpa Rick!
- Hey, I'm not judging.

56
00:02:44,436 --> 00:02:46,354
Just like shoot straight.
I'm a man of science.

57
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:49,190
Ah, then perhaps you could
make use of this.

58
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:53,194
This microscope reveals things
beyond comprehension.

59
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,496
Grandpa, go home
and drink.

60
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,333
Why don't we do a model
of the solar system?

61
00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:09,335
That's what my Dad did with me
when I was your age.

62
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,920
Oh, okay.

63
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:13,589
You know, Rick's in his lab,
making cyborgs

64
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:15,925
and wormholes
and all that weird stuff,

65
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:17,760
but this is real science.

66
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:19,929
A man and his boy,
making planets.

67
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:22,515
Hey, how about we use
a ping-pong ball for Pluto?

68
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,975
And then Jupiter...

69
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:26,561
Uh, actually, I don't
think Pluto's a planet.

70
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:29,939
Of course Pluto's
a planet, son.

71
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,816
I learned that
in the third grade.

72
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,568
Well, yeah, but you
know they changed it.

73
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:35,528
Morty, nobody changed
the planets.

74
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:37,947
I just googled it.
Pluto's not a planet.

75
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,949
They changed it in 2006.

76
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,660
Yeah, I heard about
that, Morty.

77
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,538
And I disagree.
- You disagree?

78
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:48,040
That's right. It's possible
to disagree in science, Morty.

79
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,709
Pluto was a planet.

80
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:51,377
Some committee of
fancy assholes disagree.

81
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,379
I disagree back.
Give me a ping-pong ball.

82
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,840
Um, okay.
I-I just have to...

83
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:57,675
Go find Rick and go
over my head about Pluto?

84
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,885
No. Geez!

85
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,304
I just gotta go
to the bathroom. Damn.

86
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:04,182
Oh.
Okay, good.

87
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:05,850
This is gonna be fun.

88
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,686
Hey, Morty, let me...
let me...

89
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,605
let me ask you a question
real quick.

90
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,440
Does evil exist,
and if so,

91
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:14,192
can one detect and measure it?

92
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,027
- Um...
- Rhetorical question, Morty.

93
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:18,404
The answer's "yes, you just
have to be a genius."

94
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:20,323
Cute. Your sister's boss
gave me a microscope

95
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:21,908
that would have
made me retarded.

96
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:23,701
Ooh.
Oh, boy, Rick.

97
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:25,703
I'm don't think you're allowed
to say that word, you know?

98
00:04:25,788 --> 00:04:28,080
Morty, I'm not disparaging
the differently abled.

99
00:04:28,165 --> 00:04:30,500
I'm stating the fact that
if I had used this microscope,

100
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,126
it would have made me
mentally retarded.

101
00:04:32,211 --> 00:04:34,587
Okay, yeah, but I don't think
it's about logic, Rick.

102
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:36,506
I think the word has just
become a symbolic issue for

103
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,008
powerful groups that are
doing the right thing.

104
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:40,718
Well, that's retarded.

105
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:42,595
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, nothing.

106
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,639
You asked him if
Pluto's a planet, didn't you?

107
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:45,723
- No!
- It's not.

108
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,225
- Shut up, Rick.
- Whoa.

109
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,893
I don't care what
anyone says.

110
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:51,729
If it can be a planet,
it can be a planet again.

111
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:54,649
Planet.
Planet, planet, planet.

112
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,151
Stay scientific, Jerry.

113
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,780
This aftershave made women
want me,

114
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,782
but it also made me
impotent!

115
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,493
A price for everything,
Mr. Goldenfold.

116
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:07,829
A price for everything.

117
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:11,541
Oh, my god!

118
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,252
How could I not
see this coming?!

119
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:18,005
My lust!

120
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,216
My greed!

121
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,802
I deserved this!

122
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:25,805
This serum should
counteract the negative effects.

123
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,516
Holy cats!
Ladies, let's get out of here.

124
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,518
I haven't learned a thing!

125
00:05:30,602 --> 00:05:31,936
Here.

126
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,688
You can have
this back.

127
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:34,939
You didn't use it?

128
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:36,816
Sure I did...
to develop this.

129
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,901
It detects and catalogs
all your "Twilight Zone,"

130
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:41,404
Ray Bradbury,
"Friday the 13th" The Series

131
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,072
voodoo crap magic.

132
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,574
I thought you might
want it so you didn't

133
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,076
accidentally
sell anybody, say...

134
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,620
A typewriter that generates
best-selling murder mysteries

135
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:52,540
and then makes the murders
happen in real life?

136
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:53,499
Ooh.
- Be quiet.

137
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:54,917
Don't you want to make sure

138
00:05:55,002 --> 00:05:56,502
people know what they're
getting?

139
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:58,629
You're not intentionally
selling...

140
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:00,423
Beauty cream that makes
ugly ladies pretty

141
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,675
but also makes
them blind?

142
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,677
I find this all quite
preposterous.

143
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,679
Oh, I say, good sir.
Oh, harrumph.

144
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:09,640
Oh, oh!

145
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:11,142
That's beautiful.

146
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:13,978
You know it's gonna be wearing
you in three hours?

147
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:15,730
Do I need to call the police?

148
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,148
Here, you can use
my phone.

149
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:18,691
Don't worry, it won't
make you deaf

150
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:20,026
because I'm not a hack.

151
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,444
Hey!

152
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:24,488
You think you're fucking
so great!

153
00:06:24,573 --> 00:06:26,365
Stop it! No!

154
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,242
Fuck yeah, man.

155
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:29,994
Stop it right now!

156
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:32,079
Grandpa Rick,
I like working here.

157
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:34,248
- You work for the devil.
- So what?

158
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,917
- "So what?"
- Yes!

159
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,585
So what
if he's the devil, Rick?

160
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:39,253
At least the devil
has a job.

161
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:41,005
At least he's active
in the community.

162
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:42,673
What do you do?

163
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:44,759
You eat our food
and make gadgets.

164
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:47,136
Buh-bye.

165
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,638
WhOops.

166
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,725
I'm sorry, Mr. Needful.
I'll clean that up.

167
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,518
I don't know what I can do
about the ghost lady

168
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:56,187
that came out of it, but...
- It's fine.

169
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:58,147
Summer, you know,
your grandfather's right.

170
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:00,942
This store curses people.
That's my business.

171
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:03,361
Well, yeah.
Fast-food gives people diabetes,

172
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:05,196
and clothing stores have
sweatshops.

173
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,406
Is there a company hiring
teenagers that isn't evil?

174
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:09,116
This is my first job.

175
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,826
You've been nice to me,
Mr. Needful.

176
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:12,620
You respect me.

177
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:15,122
Please, call me "The Devil."

178
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:16,958
I'd rather not,
actually.

179
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,793
Yes, perhaps not during
business hours.

180
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:20,795
I told you, I want to
file a declaration

181
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,964
that Pluto is a planet.

182
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:25,299
Well, then my son's going to
fail his science class,

183
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:27,510
and when that happens,
I'm suing you first.

184
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,846
I think I know what the "A"
in N.A.S.A. stands for.

185
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:33,724
- Dad, what's your endgame?
- Ain't no game, sucka.

186
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:35,476
Why don't we just make the solar
system with eight planets?

187
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,769
It's even easier.

188
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:39,939
Sure, sure, and why don't we
just burn Galileo at the stake

189
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:41,941
for saying the sun
is round?

190
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:44,151
Science isn't always easy,
Morty.

191
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:47,363
Whoa! Whoa!

192
00:07:47,447 --> 00:07:48,990
What the hell?!

193
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,422
I'm King Flippy Nips,
ruler of Pluto.

194
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,757
We discovered you quite
by accident

195
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:09,427
during routine surveillance
of your world.

196
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:12,471
You really gave it to those
guys at N.A.S.A.

197
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:13,973
I was... you know,

198
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:16,308
sometimes science is
about conviction.

199
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:18,811
It'd like to introduce you
to a few people

200
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:20,813
that very much agree
with you.

201
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:22,648
Oh, I...

202
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,942
Plutonians.

203
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:26,986
Jerry Smith is a scientist
from Earth,

204
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,489
where he's creating a model
of our solar system.

205
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:33,826
Jerry, tell Pluto
about your decision.

206
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:38,039
Um... Pluto's a planet.

207
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,293
Pluto's a fucking
planet, bitch!

208
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:45,838
Oh, man. This is definitely
gonna go to his head.

209
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:49,633
If it's athletic prowess
you desire, Principal Vagina,

210
00:08:49,718 --> 00:08:51,510
I might...
- I'll take it.

211
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:52,553
B-But I haven't even...

212
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:53,637
Thank you very, very much.

213
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:55,848
Great store.
Great place. Bye.

214
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,725
Huh. Okay.

215
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:00,644
I must say, Summer, I thought
your grandfather's outburst

216
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:02,021
would have disrupted business,

217
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:04,732
but this is the best weekend
I've had since Salem.

218
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:06,734
Nice. "Wholesome Delight"
for lunch?

219
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:08,736
- Is that the vegan place?
- Yeah, I love their soup.

220
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,613
I'm kind of soup-ed out.

221
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:12,531
Mrs. Tate, is it?

222
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,742
What do you desire?

223
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:16,911
Whoa, whoa, slow down,
honey.

224
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,662
Oh, is there a limit?
Everything's free, right?

225
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:22,291
Let's just say you
don't pay... with money.

226
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,293
That was perfect.

227
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:26,295
You pay with the curses,
right?

228
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,880
Um... I... well...

229
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:31,133
But, Mrs. Tate, why do you
want cursed items?

230
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:32,843
Well, I'm going to get
the curses removed

231
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:34,178
at "Curse Purge Plus."

232
00:09:34,262 --> 00:09:36,180
You know, the guy on TV?

233
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,224
What?

234
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,684
Have you acquired
creepy specific old stuf

235
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,186
from a mysterious antique
or thrift store

236
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,605
that gives you powers
but fucks with you

237
00:09:44,689 --> 00:09:45,773
in unforeseeable ways?

238
00:09:45,857 --> 00:09:47,483
Bring it
to "Curse Purge Plus."

239
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,569
I use science to
un-curse the items for cash,

240
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,154
and you get to keep
the powers.

241
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,447
This guy got mysterious
sneakers

242
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:55,699
to make him run faster,
but guess what?

243
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:57,576
He would have had to run
until he died,

244
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:58,786
making them worthless.

245
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,454
I removed the curse,
making them worth,

246
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,748
like, I don't know,
8 million.

247
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,999
See you at the Olympics.

248
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:05,501
This eerily intelligent doll

249
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,211
was threatening to murder
its family.

250
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:08,629
Now it does their taxes.

251
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,256
Everything's deductible.

252
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,966
Don't pay for cool stuff
with your soul.

253
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,509
Pay for it with money.

254
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:15,845
You know, like how every other
store in the world works?

255
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,097
We're located at First and Main
in Old Town.

256
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:19,515
Come on... come on down.

257
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:20,808
"First and..."

258
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:24,812
That's right across the street
from "Needful Things,"

259
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:27,231
where you can get evil items
for free!

260
00:10:27,315 --> 00:10:30,693
Diabolic son of a motherf...

261
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:32,695
We're back on
"Good Morning, Pluto."

262
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,697
And a very good morning it is

263
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:37,449
for our guest,
Earth scientist Jerry Smith,

264
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,660
who's making headlines
with his bold announcement

265
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:41,829
that is what, Jerry?

266
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,497
Pluto is a planet.

267
00:10:43,582 --> 00:10:45,291
Well, how about that.

268
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,293
I love it.

269
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:49,712
Morty Smith.
I'm Scroopy Noopers.

270
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:51,839
I'm a scientist.
Can I show you something?

271
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:53,716
Uh, I better not.

272
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,177
Right now.

273
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,888
The center of Pluto,
Mr. Smith,

274
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:01,140
is made of a substance called
"plutonium."

275
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:04,852
mines like these suck plutonium
up to the cities,

276
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,146
where corporations use it
to power everything,

277
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,858
from diamond cars
to golden showers.

278
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:13,861
And the more we remove,
the more Pluto shrinks.

279
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,863
There it goes again.

280
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,489
Just shrank a little.

281
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:18,741
But a few years ago,

282
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,660
your scientists noticed Pluto
had gotten so small

283
00:11:21,745 --> 00:11:23,954
they couldn't even call it
a "planet" anymore.

284
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,831
Should've been
our wake-up call.

285
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,625
But the rich plutonians
won't wake up,

286
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:30,502
and they love your Dad telling
everyone Pluto's a planet

287
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:32,546
because that means
they can keep mining

288
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:35,883
until Pluto goes
from planet to asteroid

289
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:39,178
to meteor, and finally...

290
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:41,764
poof.
- Um, a party?

291
00:11:41,848 --> 00:11:43,224
Is everyone in your family
an idiot?

292
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:44,975
Well, for sure
me and my Dad are.

293
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,810
Well, all you have to do

294
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:48,437
is get him to admit that,

295
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:51,023
and you could save
four billion lives.

296
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:56,070
Yeah, you know, the thing is
my Dad's really insecure.

297
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,323
Hmm. Funny.

298
00:11:59,407 --> 00:12:01,659
Mr. Needful, out of everything
in the store,

299
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:04,370
you'll never guess
what we couldn't get rid of.

300
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:07,998
Oh, my god.

301
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,669
Oh, my god.

302
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:16,340
I wish this desk was
lighter.

303
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:19,426
I wish this knot was looser.

304
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,220
Come on.

305
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:23,889
I don't...

306
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:27,059
Wait, what am I doing?

307
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:29,270
I wish I knew CPR.

308
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:30,562
1, 2, 3.

309
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,273
Oh, Jesus.

310
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:34,525
What a waste of a monkey paw.

311
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,527
Mr. Needful, how
could you even think of doing

312
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:38,153
something so horrible?

313
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:39,822
I'm the devil.
What should I do

314
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:42,074
when I fail...
get myself an ice cream?

315
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,409
You haven't failed.

316
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:45,327
People like Rick
are making me obsolete.

317
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,329
I mean, seriously.
I may be "the devil,"

318
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:50,040
but your grandpa is
the devil.

319
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,500
I just want to go
back to hell,

320
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:53,210
where everyone thinks
I'm smart and funny.

321
00:12:53,295 --> 00:12:54,920
No!
It's not fair.

322
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:57,214
Everyone in this town
got something they wanted

323
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:58,382
from you... even Rick.

324
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:01,552
I was your only friend,
and I get nothing?

325
00:13:01,636 --> 00:13:04,513
Okay. I'll give you one thing.
Name it.

326
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:06,849
I want to help you.

327
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:07,850
Clever twist.

328
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,102
I learned from
the best, you old fart.

329
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:12,229
Now, let's go get you
hydrated.

330
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:13,939
Looks like we've got...

331
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:15,941
haunted boxing gloves
that will make you

332
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,901
the heavyweight champion
in 1936,

333
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,862
and then you'll be
trapped there,

334
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,363
winning the same fight
for eternity.

335
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,324
I can take out the "eternity"
and the padding,

336
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:26,035
and then you'll have some
time-traveling mittens.

337
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,037
Oh, look,
it's Rosemary's Baby.

338
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,747
How's business?

339
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,623
Here's the last
of our inventory.

340
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,585
We're going to file chapter 11
and do some restructuring.

341
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,503
Sounds like code for
"You win, Rick."

342
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:38,464
That was important
to you, wasn't it?

343
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:40,132
Nope. It was important
to your dumb devil friend.

344
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:41,842
To me, this was all
just a bit,

345
00:13:41,926 --> 00:13:43,469
like when Bugs Bunny fucks
with the opera singer

346
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:44,678
for 20 minutes.

347
00:13:44,763 --> 00:13:46,305
He tried to kill himself.

348
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,557
Seriously? Holy crap.

349
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:50,267
Holy crap.

350
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:52,061
But you know what,
Grandpa Rick?

351
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,021
He's strong, and he's never
going to give up.

352
00:13:54,105 --> 00:13:56,565
- Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care.
- Oh, I know.

353
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,442
- Everyone knows you don't care.
- So?

354
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:00,444
So have fun not
caring.

355
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:02,196
- I always do.
- Good.

356
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,073
Yeah, it is good.
It's the best.

357
00:14:04,157 --> 00:14:06,158
I'm sure it is.

358
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:07,743
- Bye.
- Later.

359
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:10,162
I'm here to pick up
my undead cat and child.

360
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,414
Yeah, uh...
give me a sec.

361
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,792
These are the forms
for the employee health plan.

362
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:18,337
All right, yeah, put...
put them on my... eh.

363
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,006
I just got bored.

364
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:23,675
Everybody out.

365
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,636
All right, just one more rally,

366
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,596
then I promise we'll get back
to your science project.

367
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,264
Dad, Pluto isn't
a planet.

368
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:30,933
It's shrinking because
of corporations.

369
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:32,935
Yeah, that's what that
anti-planet nut job

370
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:34,895
Scroopy Noopers was
screaming about

371
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:37,022
outside the Ministry of Money's
Fundraiser.

372
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:39,858
Are you telling me four billion
Plutonians are wrong?

373
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:41,568
You said science
wasn't easy.

374
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:43,278
I said science
isn't always easy.

375
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:45,864
Obviously, that means
sometimes it is easy.

376
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:48,075
Let's not debase ourselves
with word games, son.

377
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,576
Dad, their whole
planet is dying.

378
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:52,955
Ha! You called it a planet.
Checkmate.

379
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,873
What's up, Pluto?

380
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:01,130
Mr. Smith, please tell
my friend here

381
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,090
what you just told me.
Go on.

382
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:05,551
My very eager mother
just served us nine pickles,

383
00:15:05,635 --> 00:15:07,511
and the "pickles"
is Pluto.

384
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:10,222
My god, the man's a genius.

385
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:12,141
Um, excuse me.

386
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:14,226
Morty, what?

387
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,103
Dad, what did you
think about the recent report

388
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,313
published by
The Pluto Science Reader

389
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:22,860
linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes,
and surface shrinkage

390
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:26,405
to deep-core plutonium
drilling?

391
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:29,658
Well, son, what did
you think

392
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:31,660
when you were five
and you pooped your pants,

393
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:33,912
and you threw your poopy undies
out your bedroom window

394
00:15:33,997 --> 00:15:35,664
because you
thought it was like

395
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:37,416
throwing something
in the garbage?

396
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:40,127
I mean, I'm trimming
the hedges,

397
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,837
and these things are just
hanging there.

398
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:43,839
Was I supposed to think
the poop bunny left them?

399
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:46,884
Good one, Dad.

400
00:15:46,968 --> 00:15:49,720
Hey, Morty, you want to
go on a... oh.

401
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,680
Hey, Beth.
Hello?

402
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:54,141
Hey, Jerry, you in here
being stupid?

403
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,356
Thanks.

404
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:03,275
Hey, you know, I was thinking,
you know,

405
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,568
I might watch a movie.

406
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:06,195
I am not programmed for
friendship.

407
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,280
Suit yourself.

408
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,451
Hey.
Hey.

409
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:13,827
W-W-What's going on?

410
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:17,164
Um, can you help me do
the stupid science fair project?

411
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:19,124
Whatever.

412
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,419
Jerry, you must be so excited.

413
00:16:22,504 --> 00:16:25,297
The Pluto-bel prize is
the highest honor

414
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,508
a scientist can
receive.

415
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:29,510
I'm flattered and humbled.

416
00:16:29,594 --> 00:16:32,304
Oh, I like that.
Use that in your speech.

417
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:34,598
Also, talk about Pluto
being a planet.

418
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:36,308
People like that.

419
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:37,976
Your highness, we've captured
Scroopy Noopers.

420
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:39,603
You animals! Animals!

421
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:44,316
Ooh, look who's little
journey's come to an end.

422
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,443
Take him to Pluto-namo Bay.

423
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:49,071
You can't kill the truth,
father.

424
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:51,365
- What?
- I can see you're confused.

425
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:53,242
Pluto-namo Bay is
a military prison...

426
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,118
a sort of play on words.

427
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:56,745
Did he call you
"father"?

428
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:59,289
Scroopy Noopers,
the anti-planet nutjob,

429
00:16:59,374 --> 00:17:00,958
is your son?

430
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,293
The young eat the old
if you let them, Jerry.

431
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:06,505
Pluto is a cold, cold
celestial dwarf.

432
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,757
- It's a what?
- Huh? Oh, planet.

433
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:12,135
"Pluto is a cold,
cold planet."

434
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,137
That's what I meant.

435
00:17:14,222 --> 00:17:17,224
Knock them
dead out there, you.

436
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:22,479
Pluto is...

437
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:34,700
...not a planet.

438
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:37,494
Ow! It's not a planet.

439
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:40,872
Hey!
It's not a planet!

440
00:17:40,957 --> 00:17:44,042
I'm an idiot,
and I love my son.

441
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:46,044
It was a long six hours,

442
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:48,130
but we've overhauled
"Needful Things"

443
00:17:48,214 --> 00:17:49,798
into the globally-compliant
web 4.0

444
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:53,802
"E-nomenon," n33dful.com,

445
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:56,597
spelled with threes
instead of "E's."

446
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:02,561
Okay, that's it.
We just got bought by Google!

447
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:05,397
Mm.
I'm so proud of you, Lucius.

448
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:07,899
So, how much did we make?

449
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:09,943
"We."

450
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:12,279
This is my business.
Security!

451
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,239
You're Zuckerberg-ing me?

452
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:15,866
I was Zuckerberg-ing people

453
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,576
before Zuckerberg's balls
dropped.

454
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,412
I'm the devil, bitch!
What, what?!

455
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,627
Hey!

456
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,173
- Hey, Morty.
- Oh, oh, hey, Dad.

457
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:34,134
Um, what... what are you doing
back from Pluto so quick?

458
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:37,137
Uh... some people just
can't handle the truth.

459
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:39,139
Especially dummies like me.

460
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:41,683
Morty, I'm not as smart
as your grandpa Rick,

461
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:45,020
but I promise never to make
that your problem again.

462
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:46,605
Hey, Dad.

463
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:49,775
Nobody's smarter than Rick,
but nobody else is my Dad.

464
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:51,568
You're a genius at that.

465
00:18:51,653 --> 00:18:53,570
Wow.

466
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:57,157
That's... humbling
and flattering, son.

467
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,159
Thank you.

468
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:01,453
What say we finish ourselves
an eight-planet solar system?

469
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:03,872
Um... I'm just gonna
take this thing in

470
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:05,874
and get an "A."
- Butter.

471
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,584
- But...
- You're a genius...

472
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:08,752
at being my Dad, Dad.

473
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:10,087
Quit while you're ahead.

474
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,755
And also, knock next time,
you know?

475
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,298
I mean, I'm sitting in here,
I'm 14...

476
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:14,883
I got a computer in here,
you know?

477
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,718
Oh, I... I think
I understand.

478
00:19:16,803 --> 00:19:18,345
You're really playing
with fire

479
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:19,763
when you burst in here
like that, man.

480
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:21,306
I get it. Say no more.

481
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,808
I mean, one of these days,

482
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:24,601
you know, you're gonna end
up seeing something.

483
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:26,937
I got it!
Noted. Good night.

484
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:33,360
How's your pretend
grandpa doing, aka "The Devil"?

485
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:36,196
- He dumped me.
- Oof. Sorry.

486
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,407
Did we learn a lesson here
I'm not seeing?

487
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:39,783
Not sure.

488
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,660
Maybe in a much bigger way,

489
00:19:41,744 --> 00:19:44,329
Mr. Needful gave us
both what we really wanted?

490
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:47,791
Because I was always jealous of
you hanging out with Morty,

491
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,919
and you didn't realize how much
you valued my approval?

492
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,547
- No, that's dumb.
- Yeah, not satisfying.

493
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:55,465
I'll tell you what,
though.

494
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,259
If... if... if it's satisfaction
you're after,

495
00:19:57,343 --> 00:19:58,969
I think I might
have an idea.

496
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:02,848
Uh-huh.

497
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,266
Uh-huh, totally.

W-W-Why?

520
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,941
Because sometimes
what you really need is

521
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:57,611
for someone else to pay
a horrible price.

<i>The man that once ate his own son...</i>

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,650
Wow. He's really getting
executed after all this time.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,750
You know the son that he ate was...

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,150
Your best friend...
Tommy.

9
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,250
We know.
Stop true-crime bragging.

10
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,890
I was traumatized, Summer.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,990
Okay, your generation wouldn't get that.

12
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,260
Bitch, my generation

13
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,990
gets traumatized for breakfast.

14
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,560
It took years of therapy
to even process the reality.

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,930
I mean, when I was a kid,

16
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,970
I just told myself
that Tommy had gotten lost

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,200
in the magical realm of Froopyland.

18
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,140
"Froopyland?"
My make-believe world.

19
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,810
I know the name's stupid,
but it was so real to me.

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,170
Aren't you guys supposed
to be at your father's

21
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,680
for custody weekend?

22
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,840
We're not in a hurry.
Dad sleeps until sundown.

23
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,250
Can we talk a little bit more
about this Froopy...

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,580
Not the bubble gun!

25
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,550
There's no air...

26
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,290
I gotta say, I am warming up
to the bubble gun.

27
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,720
You know, if you're so great
at naming things,

28
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,950
why don't you do it from now on?

29
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,220
- What?
- Froopyland.

30
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,460
Was it my best work?
I don't know.

31
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,130
Does it deserve
to be shit on creatively?

32
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,830
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,260
I agree with your look
of horrified realization.

34
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,900
You can be very inconsiderate sometimes.

35
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,640
Here it is.

36
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,100
You know, I collapsed
a quantum tesseract to...

37
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,170
Dad, I don't care how you made it.

38
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,710
I want to know if Tommy's
still in there!

39
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,210
Relax, Beth.

40
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,910
If he is, we'll find him.

41
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,510
He'll be the only
sun-bleached skeleton

42
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,010
with non-imaginary DNA.

This is a nightmare.

I can't believe you used to lock me up

48

in this glorified chicken coop.

Chicken coop?

50

Those are procedurally
generated clouds, Beth.

Come on, I-I-I put real
elbow grease into this place.

Well, you're supposed to put
elbow grease into your daughter!

54
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,120
Gross.

55
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,820
Do you think something ate him?
Nope.

56
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,190
Froopyland creatures
were designed to be harmless.

57

He definitely just starved to death.

58
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,690
I could have been the one
who starved to death in here.

59
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,060
What if I'd gotten hurt?

60
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,420
God, you're right.
I'm a terrible dad.

61
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,190
Well, nothing to live for.

62
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,960
Goodbye, cruel world!
Dad!

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,760
Oh, how do you like that?

64
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,670
What kind of merciless creator
makes the ground bouncy?

65
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,840
I'm gonna have to drown myself.

66
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,300
Unh!

67
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,800
Oh, no.
Oh, the water's breathable?

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,870
Who went and did that?

69
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,940
Oh, whatever.

70
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,240
Yeah, whatever.

A dad makes a toilet
look like R2-D2,

72
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,380
and it breaks the front page of Reddit,

73
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,410
but I'm Charles Manson
because I gave you

74
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,020
your own world instead of an iPad.

75
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,820
I think the words you're
looking for are... Aah!

76
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,250
Holy [bleep]
[bleep] This thing has claws!

77
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,020
Yeah, I get it.
It's a childproof world.

78
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,320
No, no, seriously,
this hurts really bad!

79
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
This thing is sinking
razor-sharp claws in...

80
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,890
Aah!
[bleep]

81
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,360
You've made your point, Dad.

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,460
Dad?

83
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,140
Ugh!

84
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,170
Whose idea was this stupid
custody weekend thing?

85
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,070
I think it's supposed to help
prevent abandonment issues.

86
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,440
I want to be abandoned.

87
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,080
Yeah, I'm talking about Dad.

88
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,950
Bienvenue a la Chez Divorced Dad.

89
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,480
Wow, Dad.

90
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,950
Your place looks way less
like a crackhouse.

91
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,450
It's actually clean,
like a cocaine house.

92
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,790
Dad, what's going on?

93
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,850
I'm simply centered, activated...

94
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,190
And telekinetic?

95
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,190
Pretty cool, huh?

96
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:27,130
Check it out.
Who wants a smoothie?

97
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,860
Oh... Oh, no.
Uh, oh, God.

98
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,170
Summer... Summer,
can you...

99
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,400
- Aah!
- Sorry.

100
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,670
You have much to learn, my Uloo.

101
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,140
Morty, Summer, this is Kiara.

102
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,010
She's a Krootabulan warrior priestess

103
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,340
from Krootabulon.

104
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,380
I-I know where Krootabulans
are from, Dad.

105
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,810
Uh, Chaimuntolo.

106
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,910
Chaimuntolo, younglings.

107
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,920
Hymen... cholo.

108
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,620
Your father's mind holds love for you.

109
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,450
I am humbled to meet in physicality.

110
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,920
Dad, are you...

111
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,890
In love with a badass, sexy alien lady?

112
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,160
Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer.
You tell me.

113
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,890
I wasn't going to ask
if you were in love

114
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,100
since you barely know her.

115
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,630
Summer.

116
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,470
Kiara and I met on that
interstellar dating service

117
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,270
Rick was always suggesting

118
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,400
when your mom and I were together.

119
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,240
And things just kind of clicked.

120
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,270
We must move!

121
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,040
Our reservation
is at 7:00.

122
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,810
I hate to see her leave,

123
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,810
but I love to watch
her phase shift away.

124
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,780
I'm sure you noticed
what she has three of,

125
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,980
but guess what she has two of?

126
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,650
Oof!

127
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,050
All right, knock it off!

128
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,460
Listen, I've been giving you a pass

129
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,520
because I'm charmed
that life finds a way, but...

130
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,430
Aah!
All right, you know what?

131
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,800
Ouch!

132
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,200
Oh!
Unh!

133
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,100
Ouch!
God!

134
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,800
Aah!

135
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,540
Agh!

136
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,340
Oh, Dad, this place is the safest.

137
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,040
Best dad ever.

138
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,210
Can't you just say,
"I admit it, I screwed up"?

139
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,510
Uh, what would be the point of that?

140
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,880
You can't do it, can you?

141
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,110
You can't just [bleep] apologize.

142
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,350
Okay, okay, Beth, I'm sorry...

143
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,280
you think you deserve an apology.

144
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,220
Hey, don't look at me.

145
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,890
You let your kid roll around
on the floor of a target,

146
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,090
it's gonna get stepped on.

147
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,430
Huh. Well, here's the problem
right here.

148
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,130
We've got a bunch of
Froopyland procedural carbons

149
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,530
all gummed up and mixed in
with real human DNA.

150
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,700
Are you saying Tommy survived here

151
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,170
by having sex with Froopy creatures,

152
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,340
creating Froopy-human
hybrid offspring,

153
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,510
and then consuming their proteins,

154
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,440
sustaining himself with an endless
cycle of cannibalistic incest?

155
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,640
It's just a working theory.

156
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,140
Of course, if that's the case,

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,580
I expect he'd be worshiped
as a kind of god

158
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,850
by a medieval-level
society

159
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,020
of his least-delicious
children.

160
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,620
Halt!

161
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,650
You are now prisoners
of our exalted ruler,

162
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,990
giver and taker of life,

163
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,920
helper and consumer of mortality,

164
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,360
dispenser of life...
Yes, if I could interrupt?

165
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,590
We're way ahead of the reveal here.

166
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,190
Yeah, just take us to King Tommy.

167
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,760
I thought warrior priestesses

168
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,430
could only leave Krootabulon on a hunt.

169
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,560
Mmm.
Thank you, sweetie.

170
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,970
I hope it's not human season.

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix.
I would never hunt a human.

172
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,500
Your father and I
are soul-bonded.

173
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,940
Soul-bonded?

174
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,540
Um, does your planet have shorter days,

175
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,480
because you guys are moving
kind of fast, no?

176
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,320
Go get him, honey!

177
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,490
She's always hunting.

178
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,250
She probably knew a Varrix worked here,

179
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,620
and that's why she said
the Yelp reviews didn't matter.

180
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,360
Dad, do you understand

181
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,190
how serious
Krootabulon soul-bonding is?

182
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,830
Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know.
It's got such a casual name.

183
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,230
If you want to lecture anyone
about commitment,

184
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,670
start with your mom.

185
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,270
Oh, my God.
Dad, is that what this is about?

186
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,200
Are you rushing into a new thing
to get back at Mom?

187
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,470
Every weekend, you two
have told me to move on.

188
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,270
Move on, like, out of bed.

189
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,210
Like, stop using paper towels
for toilet paper,

190
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,580
not move on into a sloppy rebound.

191
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,250
Dad, you need to slow down,
rethink this soul bond.

192
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,480
Why don't you just say
what you really mean?

193
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,550
You think it's cool

194
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,650
that having sex with her
gives me telekinesis

195
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,520
and you recognize she's got a hot bod

196
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,290
like Cheetara in "Thundercats,"

197
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,590
but you're grossed out

198
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,260
by her avocado-shaped head
and blue skin,

199
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,930
and you think I want to put
a bag and a wig on her head.

200
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,030
After all the time and energy I spent

201
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,300
teaching you two about race...

202
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,070
you ended up racist.

203
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,010
Soon your world will be rid of Varrix.

204
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,110
Tomorrow, we celebrate.

205
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,410
We could take the kids
to the water park.

206
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,550
We celebrate with a hunt!

207
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,450
Ooh.
You kids want to hunt?

208
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

209
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,390
All kneel for King Tommy!

210
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,290
I'm not kneeling.
Suck my [bleep]

211
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,360
Well, hello, all!

212
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,830
I am the King of Froopyland,

213
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,360
but I go by another name, too.

214
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
We know.
It's Tommy!

215
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,430
- We know.
- We know.

216
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,500
I have lived here
since I was a mere child.

217
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,700
- We know.
- Got it.

218
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,170
I suppose you're wondering,

219
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,270
how do I sustain myself?

220
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,570
- Oh, boy.
- No, we aren't.

221
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,440
I always find the theater

222
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,680
is the best way to clarify things.

223
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,750
- Ugh.
- Seriously?

224
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,910
Oh, my God.
Players, go!

225
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,420
I am little Tommy.

226
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,320
I am tiny Beth.

227
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,290
Oh, come on.

228
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,290
Come with me to a magic land.

229
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,590
Don't do it!

230
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,790
This is my secret Froopyland

231
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,500
where I have no rules!

232
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,200
I am excited.

233
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,240
I am jealous of Tommy's friends
and his Nintendo

234
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,440
and his dad who likes him.

235
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,570
I take it Tommy wasn't class playwright.

236
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,710
You want to see the Honey Swamp?

237
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,580
Yes!
Let's do it!

238
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,510
Well, I want to see you dead.

239
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,780
Ow, help!
I'm stuck!

240
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,320
I'm covered in honey.

241
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,780
Huh.
Well, that's interesting.

242
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,190
Fake news.

243
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,320
Many nights have passed,

244
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,690
trapped in this strange land.

245
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,860
I am hungry, and all I can do
to pass the time is hump.

246
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,460
I will hump this rock.

247
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,430
I will hump this tree.

248
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,570
I will hump this beast of the land

249
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,240
and put my seed in it.

250
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,180
I am the first of Tommy's children.

251
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,710
Eat of my flesh so you may survive.

252
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,350
And so I did.

253
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,790
Oh, wow.

254
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,320
Okay.
Yeah.

255
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,590
Certified fresh.
Good... Good job.

256
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,530
Perhaps a demonstration is in order.

257
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,630
- No, that is the last thing that is in order!
- Ugh.

258
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,160
Oh, my God.
Poor Froopy character.

259
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,160
Leave him alone.

260
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,100
Ahh.
Gather round, gang!

261
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,170
Dinner time.

262
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,340
All right, that's it.
I'm outta here.

263
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,010
What are you doing?

264
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,370
We're in the middle of an adventure.

265
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,180
Here's some things
an adventure needs, Beth.

266
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,280
Conflict, stakes,
a way for me to benefit,

267
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,780
and, clearly, Morty.

268
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,350
But Tommy's still in there,

269
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,120
raping Muppets and eating babies.

270
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,650
Yep. Luckily,
that's not our problem.

271
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,750
Time to pull the plug.

272
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,190
Pull the plug?

273
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,890
We have to get Tommy out of there, okay?

274
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
We... We need to do
the right thing.

275
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,530
Do what you never did as a dad...

276
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,730
Put in a little effort.

277
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,460
All right,
cut the high-road routine.

278
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,660
We both saw Tommy's shitty play.

279
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,500
You pushed him in the Honey Swamp, Beth.

280
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,170
His very happy life is in your hands.

281
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,900
You go save him from it.

282
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,370
You're gonna believe
a play over your own daughter?

283
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,670
Yes, I am, Beth,
because you're not my own daughter.

284
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,540
Oh, God, yes.

285
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,810
I'm one of infinite Beths

286
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,010
with infinite fathers
in infinite universes.

287
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,610
It's called a hug, Dad.
It won't kill you.

288
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,850
Yeah, don't be so sure.

289
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,350
You know why all Ricks made a Froopyland

290
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,520
for all their little girls?

291
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,920
Same reason I wasn't surprised

292
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,690
by Tommy's overwritten,
badly structured,

293
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,350
cheaply produced flashback.

294
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,860
You were a scary [bleep] kid, man.

295
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,590
Oh, my God.

296
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,430
I didn't make Froopyland
to get rid of you, Beth.

297
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,160
I did it to protect the neighborhood.

298
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,600
Not in a noble sense.

299
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,260
It was just more practical
to sequester you

300
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,670
before I had to start,
you know, cloning a replacement

301
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,340
for every less-than-polite
little boy or gullible animal

302
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,170
that might cross
your socio-path.

303
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,410
You would rather believe I'm evil

304
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,510
than admit that you were a bad father?

305
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,210
Oh, dude, no.

306
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,780
No, bad father all the way
to the max over here.

307
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,350
I'm a [bleep] nutcase.

308
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,050
And the acorn plopped
straight down, baby.

309
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,450
Look at some of this shit

310
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,920
you were asking me to make you as a kid.

311
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,350
Ray guns.

312
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,820
A whip that forces people to like you.

313
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,990
Invisibility cuffs,
a parent trap, a lightning gun,

314
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,490
a teddy bear with
anatomically correct innards,

315
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,530
night-vision googly-eye glasses,
sound-erasing sneakers,

316
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,500
false fingerprints,
fall-asleep darts,

317
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,900
a lie-detecting doll,
an indestructible baseball bat,

318
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,910
a Taser shaped like a ladybug,
a fake police badge,

319
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,480
location-tracking stickers,
rainbow-colored duct tape,

320
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,880
mind-control hair clips,
poison gum,

321
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,820
a pink, sentient switchblade.

322
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,480
Hi, Beth, you've gotten taller.

323
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,620
Shall we resume stabbing?

324
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:07,850
Has it occurred to you

325
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,260
that I asked you to make those things

326
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,020
because I wanted you
to spend time with me?

327
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,760
Has it occurred to you that
<i>if</i> I did try killing Tommy,

328
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,760
it might be because
I was jealous of his family?

329
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,420
Wait, what?
Why?

330
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,560
Wasn't his dad, like,
some kind of cannibal?

331
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,830
Seems like it must be hereditary.

332
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,970
Oh, my God.
This is your fault.

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,300
I am not a bad person.

334
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,500
I'm gonna go back in there,

335
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,640
I'm getting Tommy, and I'm fixing this!

336
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,410
Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

337
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,740
I don't know why I just said that.

338
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,310
Doesn't make a lot of sense,
but gotta stand by it.

339
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,100
Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

340
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm owning it.

341
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,550
No, Dad!
You're not doing it right!

342
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,620
Cutting off their heads
isn't doing it right?

343
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,820
They're clearly regenerative!

344
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,190
I-I think you have to stab them
through the heart or something.

345
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,960
You think or you know?

346
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,090
I thought you were the alien
expert, Isaac Asi-hole.

347
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,960
Don't snap at me!
I'm tired!

348
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
- Me, too!
- We're all tired!

349
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,870
That's the last of them.

350
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,200
Tonight, we celebrate.

351
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,370
With a hunt?

352
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,080
Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt.

353
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,290
I, uh, really have to get out
of this soul bond.

354
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,820
- What the [bleep] Dad?
- Oh, my God! Duh!

355
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,860
- Obviously!
- Yeah, no kidding!

356
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,890
Can you guys help me?

357
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,190
What? How?

358
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,090
Can I just, uh, tell her
it's because of my kids?

359
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,800
You know, like, you don't like
the shape of her head, or...

360
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,830
That's you, Dad!
That's<i> you!</i>

361
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,970
You're a baby and an idiot!

362
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,940
I think that's been established,
Summer. Now help me!

363
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,400
First, I want you to admit

364
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,870
that you're a closet racist,
a beta-male sexist,

365
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,040
and you dragged everyone
into a horrible situation

366
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
by only thinking of yourself.

367
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,340
Okay.

368
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,080
I want to hear you say it.

369
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,080
Look, I'm a closeted racist,

370
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,980
and I'm sexist and selfish,

371
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,090
and I dragged us all into
my sexist, racist bad things

372
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,860
because I'm stupid.
Thank you.

373
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,860
Now you're gonna help me, right?
She just did.

374
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,760
Yeah, clean up your own mess.

375
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,700
Wait, wait, what?

376
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,260
Oh, man.

377
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,170
All right, everybody.

378
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,630
Next item on the docket...

379
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,840
I would like to have sex
with some of you,

380
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,400
and then eat the babies.

381
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,870
I thought you'd like that.

382
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,710
I do keep rolling out the hits, don't I?

383
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,650
Oh!
It's the Magic Crayon Lady!

384
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,210
Are you hungry?
I was just about to make dinner.

385
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,920
And by "make dinner," I mean...

386
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,650
Tommy, I'm going to take you
to the real world.

387
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,050
Well, this<i> is</i> the real world.

388
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,690
No, you don't understand!
Your dad...

389
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,420
Uh, people think your dad ate you!

390
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,160
So?
You doy-oy!

391
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,660
People should eat people.

392
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,860
Just leave me alone!

393
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,660
Tommy, you don't understand.

394
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,960
I have to make this right

395
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
because it's my fault
that you're in here.

396
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,900
I'm Beth.

397
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,970
- Beth?
- The destroyer!

398
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,170
The destroyer!

399
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,070
Oh, suck it up, Princess Incest.

400
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,710
You fell into some honey.

401
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,040
Well, it tends to happen
when one is pushed into honey.

402
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,080
I respect your right
to believe I pushed you.

403
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,080
Oh, do I get to have that?

404
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,050
Is my reality like
a little side of fries...

405
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,790
a little Kwanzaa
you're willing to slide my way?

406
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,460
Yes, because I'm focused
on saving your father's life

407
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,290
because I'm not a petty piece of [bleep]

408
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,390
So, then, it should be pretty easy

409
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,700
to say,
"Sorry I pushed you."

410
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,160
Real easy and not necessary,

411
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,770
since you coming home
will save your dad's life

412
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,130
whereas nothing is changed

413
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,900
by anyone stroking
your batshit-crazy ego.

414
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,270
Sorry, forgive me.

415
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,870
Uh, I've been in Froopyland
for quite a while.

416
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,370
Have apologies changed?

417
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,080
Tommy, I'm sorry you think
you deserve an apology.

418
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,380
Oh, my God.
I'm my father.

419
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,210
Uh, will someone
just kill this B-word?

420
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,850
Hi-ya!

421
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,190
Oh, my God.
I'm my father!

422
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,420
Ya!
Ooh! Froopy!

423
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,020
It's stab time!
Ooh!

424
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,390
And that's why one pussy
plus two pussies

425
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,230
makes a bunch of pussies.

426
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,460
Come on, y'all, I'm trying to make this

427
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,370
appealing to your
sex-addicted lifestyles.

428
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,140
Hi, I need to pull Morty out of
school. Come on, Morty.

429
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,040
Ha! You heard
your daddy, Morty.

430
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,370
you have to leave school.

431
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,140
Wait, what are my values?

432
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,010
Dad, what's going on?
We're going to Alaska.

433
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,610
What? Why?
It's nice there.

434
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,850
Also, I broke up with Kiara,
and she didn't take it well,

435
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,050
and she wants to murder you two.

436
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,920
What? Th-Then why
are we walking?

437
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,120
I'm walking because I'm tired.

438
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,250
You guys should definitely run.

439
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,260
Excuse me, I just...

440
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,220
You know what?
I'm... I'm just gonna go left.

441
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,130
No, okay, your left, that's fine.

442
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,400
Do you know what left is,
'cause... Ugh!

443
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,300
What does your breakup
have to do with us?

444
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,170
Yeah, we chose Mom hands down.

445
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,900
I thought we made that clear
at the lawyer's office

446
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,270
and in the comments under
your weird rant on Facebook.

447
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,240
She kind of blames you guys
for the breakup.

448
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,510
- Why?
- Why?

449
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,940
Because I told her it was your fault.

450
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,380
- What?!
- What?!

451
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,980
Look, I'm not an evil person.

452
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,550
I'm just not very imaginative!

453
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,320

Okay, 'cause he, um...

464
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,180
Yeah, he didn't want to come back,

465
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,510
so, um, he gave me this.

466
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,380
He gave you his finger?

It's okay.
It doesn't matter. Okay.

469

- ♪ Ooh ♪
- ♪ And there isn't a song ♪

482
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,220
♪ That can change that ♪

483
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,590
I am wiped out.
I guess I'll turn in.

484
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,160
Cool.

485
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,360
Dad?

486
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,260
I feel like I've spent my life

487
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,940
pretending you're a great guy
and trying to be like you.

488
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,470
And the ugly truth has always been...

489
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,440
That I'm not that great a guy
and you're exactly like me.

490
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,540
Am I evil?

491
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,240
Worse.
You're smart.

492
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,480
When you know nothing matters,
the universe is yours.

493
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,580
And I've never met a universe
that was into it.

494
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,320
The universe is basically an animal.

495
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,620
It grazes on the ordinary.

496
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,920
It creates infinite idiots
just to eat them,

497
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
not unlike your friend Timmy.
Tommy.

498
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,520
Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie.

499
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,490
You know, smart people get
a chance to climb on top,

500
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,790
take reality for a ride,

501
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,500
but it'll never stop
trying to throw you.

502
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,700
And, eventually, it will.

503
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,560
There's no other way off.

504
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,930
Dad, I'm out of excuses
to not be who I am.

505
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,940
So who am I?
What do I do?

506
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,740
My advice...
Take off.

507
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,110
Put a saddle on your universe.
Let it kick itself out.

508
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,310
I can't do that.

509
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,080
The kids, Jerry, my job,

510
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,080
and, as much as I hate to admit
it, ABC's "The Bachelor."

511
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,180
I can make a clone of you,
a perfect instance of you,

512
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
with all your memories.

513
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,720
An exact copy in every way.

514
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,890
It'll love and provide for the kids,

515
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,890
do your job, and consume
broadcast-network reality TV

516
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,390
on the same allegedly ironic
level as you.

517
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,590
You could be gone a day, a week,

518
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,000
or the rest of your life
with zero consequences.

519
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,330
The moment you decide to come back,

520
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,770
I flip a switch,
and the clone's job is done.

521
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,540
It feels no pain, it regrets nothing,

522
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,110
and has zero chance
of going "Blade Runner."

523
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,770
If nothing matters,
why would you do that for me?

524
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,680
I don't know, maybe you matter
so little that I like you.

525
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,410
Or maybe it makes you matter.

526
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,650
Maybe I love you.

527
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,710
Maybe something about your mother.

528
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,420
Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth.

529
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,690
I don't know if I can do it.

530
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,650
Then stay, and luxuriate in a life

531
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,590
you can finally know you've chosen.

532
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,030
My secret bonus is that
no matter what you choose,

533
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,760
you're finally gonna
chill the [bleep] out.

534
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,470
Okay.

535
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,640
I know what I want to do.

536
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,770
Aah!

537
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,340
Ow!

538
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,380
You can't run forever!

539
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,710
She's really pissed off.

540
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,510
I know.
It's kinda hot.

541
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,680
Shut up!

542
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,150
The hunters!
They're back! Run!

543
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,620
- We're not hunters.
- We want to hide with you.

544
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,420
We're not hiding.
We're nesting.

545
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,420
Ooh la la.

546
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,760
The children must be destroyed

547
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,120
so that we can be together.

548
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,530
You need to break up with her,
Dad... properly!

549
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,560
God damn it, Dad!

550
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,500
Dump her!

551
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,630
Okay, okay.

552
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,500
Kiara, let's just run away.

553
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,500
- Dad!
- Come on!

554
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,970
Just rip
the Band-Aid off!

555
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,370
Okay!

556
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,340
Kiara, when I told you
my kids were bigoted racists

557
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,240
who were demanding I break up with you,

558
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,640
I lied.

559
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,510
If anybody deserves to be
telekinetically strangled,

560
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,080
it's me.

561
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,750
<i>I'm</i> the one who wants to break up.

562
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,190
I... I'm not
an evil person.

563
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,620
I'm lazy, I'm cowardly,

564
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,020
and... and I do not
know what I'm doing.

565
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,160
Look, I got someone pregnant at 17.

566
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,760
We're getting a divorce.
None of this is on purpose.

567
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,400
I was excited to date someone cool

568
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,530
because it would make my ex notice me.

569
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,140
I would expect nothing less
from humanity...

570
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,640
a selfish, manipulative,
dishonest species that...

571
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,740
- Kiara?
- Trandor!

572
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,780
What are you doing here?

573
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,450
Just... hunting.

574
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,110
Do you really expect me to believe

575
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,220
it has nothing to do with us?

576
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,680
You knew Earth was my domain.

577
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,650
I don't like what you're insinuating.

578
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,720
Dad, can we go now?
Hold on a second.

579
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,620
I'm starting to get the feeling
that<i> I</i> was the rebound.

580
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,490
Dad, you just got handed an Ex Machina.

581
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,760
You're taking it.

582
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,460
Varrix nests spread across 300 galaxies,

583
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,200
and you just happened to pick
this planet to hunt?

584
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,300
That's Gorgon shit...
total Gorgon shit!

585
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:28,310
We're home!

586
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,880
Hey, guys!
What's for dinner?

587
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,480
How was Jerry's?
The usual.

588
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,880
Can we have pizza?
Pizza sounds great.

589
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,850
Hey, Rick, did you know my dad
was dating an alien?

590
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,550
No. Gross.
For the alien.

591
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,750
Aw, crap, I think Arnaldo's is closed.

592
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,650
Are you guys sure you want pizza?

593
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,790
Arnaldo's isn't closed in the dimension

594
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,530
where they didn't invent
Daylight Savings!

595
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,400
What would we do without you?
I love you, Dad.

596
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,860
Love you, too, sweetie.

597
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,000
By the way, that wasn't time travel.

598
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,570
There were just a couple pizzas
on the counter.

599
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,270
I grabbed them.

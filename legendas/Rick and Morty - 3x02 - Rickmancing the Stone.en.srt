1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:04,036
Ohh! Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest,

2
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:08,014
can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off? It's called "carpe diem," Morty.

3
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:11,002
You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even You don't even know what it means!

4
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:15,006
That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin' all them diems.

5
00:00:15,012 --> 00:00:16,052
Listen to your sister, Morty.

6
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:17,082
To live is to risk it all.

7
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:19,082
Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly

8
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:22,066
assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you.

9
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:23,048
Oh, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,002
Jerry, I didn't see you there.

11
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:27,002
H-How much of that did you hear? All of it.

12
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,002
You were looking right at me.

13
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:31,040
I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.

14
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:32,050
Just stay in the driveway.

15
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,050
The killbots are live, and I took you off the white list.

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,018
W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right? Absolutely, Morty.

17
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:41,024
A-And your Mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement,

18
00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:43,042
he can help me sue for full custody.

19
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,088
Th-That'll be nice.

20
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:46,084
Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving.

21
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:47,030
- Bye, Dad.

22
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,088
Rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure

23
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:53,012
immediately somewhere else I don't care even if it might kill us?

24
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,002
I did not, but if you're really that alienated,

25
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,002
I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy,

26
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,002
church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer.

27
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:01,032
I'm ready when you are.

28
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:04,082
Bitch, I was ready yest Bye, sweetie.

29
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:07,022
Well, I-I better Sure.

30
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:09,022
Sounds important.

31
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,084
If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh Okay.

32
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,026
Loser.

33
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:32,012
What? Hello? Morty, shoot the Mohawk guy! -

34
00:02:16,014 --> 00:02:17,092
They all have Mohawks! -

35
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:20,076
High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top.

36
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:28,012
Shoot him! Ah! Light them up.

37
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:31,030
Ahh! [], Get in the game, Morty!

38
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,030
Give me your flask!

39
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,070
Holy fuck, Summer for the win!

40
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,098
I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!

41
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:48,030
Here we go! Isotope 322.

42
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,088
This stuff's so powerful, Morty,

43
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:52,088
it makes Isotope 465 look like Isotope 317.

44
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,074
- Uh-huh, yeah.

45
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:55,020
Is it powerful enough to keep those

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,022
guys from murdering us? Summer! - Hold on.

47
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:00,066
I want to try something.

48
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:04,092
Rick, can we not leave without my sister? Ugh.

49
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:06,092
You have infinite sisters, Morty.

50
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:08,010
I mean, n-not that I want to spend the

51
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,064
rest of my day looking for another one.

52
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,064
"Sum-sum," let's go! Grandpa's concern

53
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:13,064
for your safety is fleeting!

54
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,020
Your blood will be my lotion.

55
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:23,096
That was cool.

56
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,032
Kill me, please.

57
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:28,032
Okay, but not because you told me to.

58
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:31,000
Summer! Okay.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Getting darker.

60
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,084
Jesus Christ.

61
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,084
Summer! Aw, come on.

62
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:43,016
Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them.

63
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,064
I am Hemorrhage.

64
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:48,020
You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger.

65
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,026
We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.

66
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:54,026
Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?

67
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,026
They don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them.

68
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:58,008
They're basically pussies.

69
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:59,058
- What is your deal lately?

70
00:03:59,058 --> 00:04:00,074
All right, let's get sloppy.

71
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,062
Oh, whoa.

72
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:03,062
Uh, uh, what's, uh What's that little

73
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:05,062
bauble you got back there? Th-Th-That's interesting.

74
00:04:05,062 --> 00:04:07,062
That is our glowing rock.

75
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,062
We carry it with us for desecration,

76
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:12,030
to remind us there are no gods.

77
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,002
Kids, weird pitch let's have this be our new life.

78
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:19,080
Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers! - Okay.

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:26,058
- What? Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers

80
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,044
are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people.

81
00:04:29,044 --> 00:04:30,006
I'm going.

82
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,094
Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately.

83
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:35,078
You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her.

84
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:37,006
And, you know, I don't think this is a

85
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:38,046
great place for her to be right now.

86
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:41,002
Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge.

87
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:43,002
This world may be rough around the edges,

88
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:44,044
but it's got its charms.

89
00:04:44,044 --> 00:04:47,098
Bicep or quadricep? Uh bicep.

90
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:56,018
Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat

91
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:59,062
human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here? No.

92
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:01,056
Okay, I'll level with you.

93
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,010
You see that green rock, Morty?

94
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,050
It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.

95
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,064
Isotope 322.

96
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:10,086
Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake.

97
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:12,022
I can explain the math to you later,

98
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:15,016
but Summer just ran off with strangers that have "Death" in their name,

99
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:16,090
and the rest of their name was "Stalkers.

100
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,058
" Huh, could be therapeutic for her.

101
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:20,058
She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty.

102
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:22,058
I mean, her parents are going through a divorce

103
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:24,058
Damn it, Rick, that's what I Fine.

104
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:27,050
Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her,

105
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,006
and let's get the "F" out of "H".

106
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:30,098
Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey.

107
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:32,066
I need you to distract the camp.

108
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,022
"Distract"? They eat each other.

109
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,074
What What do you want me to do to get their attention,

110
00:05:35,074 --> 00:05:38,056
put on a puppet show? Right idea, wrong genre, Morty.

111
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:40,056
The equivalent here would be

112
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:42,056
Hey, you guys ever use that Thunderdome,

113
00:05:42,056 --> 00:05:44,056
or do you just put it up for decoration?

114
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:46,080
Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?

115
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:49,006
Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B.White.

116
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:51,060
Ohh, burn! The important question is,

117
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,036
who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here?

118
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,026
I guess I'll see your asses in that dome!

119
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,074
Rick, what the hell, man?

120
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:01,042
Wh-What are you, out of your mind? Morty, relax.

121
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:02,030
You're gonna be a ringer.

122
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,030
Come here.

123
00:06:04,054 --> 00:06:07,038
This device extracts and redistributes muscle memory.

124
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,058
I'm giving your body a 10-year course in wasteland combat one limb at a time.

125
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:14,000
Ow! I'm working with a mixed bag here,

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,038
so you may not have perfect coordination, Morty Ugh!

127
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:20,034
Hey! - I-I didn't do that! Okay, this is exciting.

128
00:06:20,034 --> 00:06:22,054
We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.

129
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:26,058
Ooh! Help! Help! Oh, sweet, man!

130
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:33,072
And so it begins, my pretties! Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!

131
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:36,048
Just stick and move, Morty! Wear him out!

132
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:44,024
How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear

133
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:47,098
khakis and hockey jerseys? After the boom-boom, some adapted to the new truth,

134
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:50,068
and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes,

135
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:53,026
clinging to the lie of the before-fore times.

136
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,054
The raidy-rays rotted them away,

137
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:59,000
leaving only their love for the vert-vert-isements on billyboards.

138
00:06:59,082 --> 00:07:02,082
Did the boomy-booms blow up all your wordy-word books?

139
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:04,004
You mean dictionaries?

140
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:13,012
I think I was a child before the boom-booms.

141
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,086
I think I looked like this.

142
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:17,086
Want to piss on him? Get out of my head.

143
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:23,040
Ha ha! Whoo! Unbelievable! A new champ!

144
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:31,084
Okay, no more! And he wants more! No, I don't! Someone, make this stop!

145
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,084
Mister, please get out of here, or you're gonna die!

146
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:37,080
I have nothing to do with this! Morty.

147
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,000
Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away!

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,084
Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody!

149
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:48,096
And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life,

150
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:56,048
but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man! Thank you.

151
00:07:56,094 --> 00:08:01,020
Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother!

152
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,040
Not that family means anything! This family does.

153
00:08:05,092 --> 00:08:07,022
Good job, champ.

154
00:08:07,022 --> 00:08:10,032
Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?

155
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,092
Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here.

156
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,082
C-Can we not leave just yet? - Leave? - I'm not leaving.

157
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,046
There is no "leave.

158
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,088
" We are united, or we are enemies.

159
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,008
Oh, big guy, no.

160
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:22,020
Nobody's leaving.

161
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,032
Don't be stupid.

162
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:24,084
We love being united.

163
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:26,084
W love the radiation, the trichinosis.

164
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:29,040
We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average.

165
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,086
I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.

166
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:35,070
Hey, the Green Rock is gone! - Oh, no! -

167
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,010
Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids? Ohh.

168
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,074
We'll be right back.

169
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:51,046
Grandpa, you're being stupid! Just surrender,

170
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:54,062
and our friends will give you mercy! Kiss my ass, Summer!

171
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,062
Your friends have no mercy! They're lame!

172
00:08:56,062 --> 00:09:00,014
Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!

173
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:06,030
Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?

174
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,068
When did I lose control here?

175
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:10,024
Listen to me both of you kids need to get out of this environment

176
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:12,024
so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce!

177
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:14,086
Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun,

178
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,086
and I can leave the two of you here forever!

179
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:18,086
Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice?

180
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:20,060
Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends

181
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
here or or visit home to do laundry?

182
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:26,094
All right, you know what? Fuck it!

183
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:33,044
My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline!

184
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,016
Nope.

185
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:36,052
Regular blood.

186
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:38,018
- Dad? - Hi, sweetie.

187
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:40,018
- Where are the kids? - Oh, th-they aren't with you?

188
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:41,064
I thought they were with you.

189
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:43,068
Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered.

190
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:46,014
They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related.

191
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:48,020
- Not panicked at all.

192
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,012
Just Oh, God, what's the divorce doing to the kids?

193
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,022
What's it doing to me?

194
00:09:52,022 --> 00:09:54,066
Did I make a mistake? Not a mistake, no!

195
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:59,074
I mean, not that I have a horse in this race, but this divorce decision listen mwah!

196
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:01,052
good for you, good for the kids.

197
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:04,026
I mean, honestly, I think that they're flourishing.

198
00:10:04,008 --> 00:10:08,028
I mean, you'll see, when when when you see them, that that they're totally flourishing.

199
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:14,002
Booyah! [] you, pal! Who else wants some?

200
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:16,002
Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today?

201
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:24,010
Hey, what's what's wrong, man? You're not getting weak on me, are you? What? Wait a minute.

202
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,026
What's the matter, you piece of crap?

203
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:40,092
Haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I'm gonna whip you.

204
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,054
Huh! It can't be.

205
00:10:43,054 --> 00:10:47,028
It can't be! I was just following orders! -

206
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:49,028
Whoa, whoa! - I was just following orders! -

207
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:51,028
Ahh! I'll tell you where my boss lives!

208
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:53,028
He's in the castle! He's in the castle!

209
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,088
This isn't over, is it? That means,

210
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:59,088
no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question?

211
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:03,020
Uh, m-make a fist if this isn't over.

212
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:05,028
This isn't over.

213
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:12,052
Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car.

214
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:14,052
We don't apologize, and we have no god.

215
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:17,016
But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain.

216
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:21,020
There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.

217
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,020
What about the weird guys on leashes, then?

218
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,078
They're more like interns.

219
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,016
Cool, cool.

220
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:30,044
Sorry.

221
00:11:30,044 --> 00:11:32,000
It's okay.

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,058
Can Isee? No one has seen my true face and lived.

223
00:11:37,058 --> 00:11:40,050
Well, I'm not afraid to die, and

224
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,050
I don't care what you look like.

225
00:11:44,092 --> 00:11:45,054
Oh.

226
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:50,008
Hmm? I just I didn't expect you to have a mustache.

227
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:51,034
- No.

228
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:52,042
I like it.

229
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,080
I guess How do I explain this?

230
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:58,072
A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of "mustache,"

231
00:11:58,072 --> 00:12:00,072
in that it's a specific facial accessory.

232
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:04,024
So, it's kind of like Do you guys have the phrase "hat on a hat"? -

233
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,020
I can shave it.

234
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:06,024
I like it.

235
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:08,024
And obviously what I like shouldn't matter.

236
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:09,036
It's you.

237
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:11,008
Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter.

238
00:12:11,008 --> 00:12:12,052
Obviously, I know that.

239
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:13,004
I'm not weak.

240
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:14,080
I'm just thinking, "Well, why not get rid of this?"

241
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,040
You just kill everyone that sees it,

242
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,006
and it's and it's hot under here, wh-which, by the way,

243
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,008
is why I shave the beard part.

244
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,008
So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity,

245
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,008
which is what I was trying to avoid with the

246
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:27,044
whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself?

247
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:29,056
Why don't I just wear a tie, right? I mean,

248
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:31,008
it's like that guy you killed when I met you,

249
00:12:31,008 --> 00:12:32,028
with the burnt dolls on his body.

250
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:34,028
I hated that guy, because, why why are you doing that?

251
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:35,098
And how can you not see how fake that is?

252
00:12:35,098 --> 00:12:37,004
And the whole time, I'm the same thing.

253
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:41,072
I'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because - Mmm.

254
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:47,038
Hey, I'm doing a coffee run Never mind.

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,048
I am Summer.

256
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:54,090
Summer, state your deal.

257
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,044
My deal is that I am, like, totally fine.

258
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,052
Morty? Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg.

259
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:02,090
Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way.

260
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,080
All right.

261
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,012
It's dinnertime.

262
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:08,098
Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner.

263
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:10,002
No problem.

264
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:12,002
Its benefits are totally, like,

265
00:13:12,002 --> 00:13:14,098
less about the food than the emotional nourishment.

266
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:16,098
Uh, okay, weirdo.

267
00:13:16,098 --> 00:13:21,040
Yeah, dial it back, Summer by 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3%.

268
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,072
Am I right? - How's school, Morty?

269
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:25,026
I like school and stuff, kind of.

270
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:30,010
And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were quote mode "staying together for the kids.

271
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,070
" End quote mode".

272
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,000
"Quote mode".

273
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,006
You millennials.

274
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:37,014
Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?

275
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:39,014
All I know is, totally, you look great.

276
00:13:39,014 --> 00:13:41,090
Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff.

277
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,098
It's crazy.

278
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,004
- So happy.

279
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:46,026
Happy family, man.

280
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,090
We got this family in the bag.

281
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,060
Oh.

282
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:52,030
Oh, sweetie, d-don't.

283
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,038
Don't I don't know why I'm crying.

284
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:57,056
It's not Well, try crying 15% less?

285
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:59,024
Mom, emotions are human.

286
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:01,092
You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.

287
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:02,020
Yeah.

288
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,004
Geez, Mom.

289
00:14:03,004 --> 00:14:05,004
Your feelings are not only forgivable,

290
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:07,078
they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon,

291
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:09,078
carbon-based entities can ever grasp.

292
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,080
- I have to call Jerry.

293
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
- You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two?

294
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,020
The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.

295
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,090
Your feelings are coming from a Tell it to my bread in the morning.

296
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,004
You just became my backup toaster.

297
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:24,014
Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti.

298
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:34,006
Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer,

299
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,072
and you'll be shipped to the wasteland.

300
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:42,044
And as for you, Genital Washer Ahh! Oh! Oh, God.

301
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:44,016
Look, whoever you are,

302
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,080
you should know that killing me won't change a thing.

303
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,008
L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one.

304
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:50,064
You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here.

305
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:51,016
Please.

306
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,076
Slavery was a family business.

307
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:54,056
I didn't ask to be born into it.

308
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:56,056
If anything, I'm the victim here.

309
00:14:56,076 --> 00:15:00,000
Uh, "Armathy," can I steal you for a second?

310
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
E-E-Excuse us, sir.

311
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,028
So, this is it, isn't it? This is the guy?

312
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:08,050
So, does that mean you'll be going away?

313
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,050
Like, does it work like a ghost?

314
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,002
Like, is is this your unfinished business?

315
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:16,008
Wh-What if we didn't do it?

316
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:18,008
What if we just went back to the Blood Dome

317
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:20,060
and just kept taking our baggage out on unrelated people?

318
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
I mean, w-we could do that forever.

319
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,004
I mean, I-I know it's less healthy, but w-w-we'd be together

320
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,092
and I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for,

321
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,060
if you're feeling out the room.

322
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,028
You're right.

323
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,050
We both got to see our stuff through.

324
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,050
I got to deal with my parents' divorce,

325
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,084
and you got to, you know, do what you got to do.

326
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,088
I love you.

327
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,086
Aw [] - Rick? - Sorry, sorry.

328
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:52,050
I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up.

329
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,066
Don't let me distract you.

330
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,060
Yeah, well, too late.

331
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,074
Just tell me what you want.

332
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:57,042
I want you and your sister to come home.

333
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,002
Oh, but don't don't you have

334
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:00,020
infinite versions of me and my sister?

335
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,010
You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty.

336
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,092
Look, there's no replacing either of you without

337
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:05,092
an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.

338
00:16:10,004 --> 00:16:11,074
Maybe the lesson we've learned is that,

339
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:14,004
whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock,

340
00:16:14,004 --> 00:16:18,056
or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.

341
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:21,028
I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty.

342
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:24,072
Shit! Wh-Wh-Wh-What do I Well, the longer you wait,

343
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:26,024
Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder.

344
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:27,096
I think your arm just called it too early

345
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:29,044
because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic.

346
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:30,028
Here.

347
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,036
It's the least I can do.

348
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:34,002
I-I-I-I owe you this much.

349
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:36,044
See, Morty? Now we're both accountable.

350
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,016
The reason I wanted this is because it can do this.

351
00:16:51,098 --> 00:16:53,066
This is a really special thing.

352
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,066
I mean, you could use it to power all your vehicles.

353
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,046
You wouldn't be reliant on gasoline.

354
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:59,012
You'll be the most advanced tribe of

355
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:02,020
radioactive cannibals in the whole this version of the world.

356
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:07,096
Can you stay to show us more? You don't have to ask me twice.

357
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,018
Home is nuts right now.

358
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,066
My daughter's going through a divorce,

359
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:13,080
and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.

360
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:22,004
Ugh [] damn it.

361
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:26,060
Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today?

362
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
Oh, you know, Eli.

363
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,050
Same [] different day.

364
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,076
Hey, Summer! Guess what.

365
00:17:30,076 --> 00:17:34,052
One man entered, one man comes out in nine months.

366
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh.

367
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,036
Congratulations, guys.

368
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,094
Uh, Summer, one more thing we noticed that

369
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:43,064
you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin.

370
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:44,038
I got it.

371
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:47,034
She's a piece of work.

372
00:17:47,036 --> 00:17:51,044
They both are, right? - I'm home.

373
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:52,034
- Hey, babe.

374
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:54,000
- Ah, Summer's home! - Hey, there she is!

375
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,004
You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning.

376
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:58,020
Blood Dome playoffs.

377
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,024
So, I can assume you haven't murdered a single person today.

378
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,096
I-I didn't mark my murders in my murder log.

379
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:05,096
I didn't know that's how we measured success.

380
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:07,012
Oh, there he is.

381
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:09,048
There's the nihilistic brute I married,

382
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:11,036
except now life only means nothing

383
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:15,068
when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on [] TV!

384
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:16,076
Jesus Christ.

385
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:18,036
When did you become a monster?

386
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:20,036
I was a monster when you met me!

387
00:18:20,036 --> 00:18:23,056
We were monsters! We didn't care about anything!

388
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:24,056
I still don't! Yeah,

389
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:26,018
except I'm the only one in this entire

390
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:29,028
world that's still committed to that! Ohh.

391
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:31,028
Ding, ding, ding! Wow.

392
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,074
Everybody hear that? Wow.

393
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:33,050
- Uh, we should go to the garage.

394
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,018
- Oh, my God.

395
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:34,050
- Uh-huh.

396
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,060
- La-di-da-di-[]-da.

397
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:38,034
The only one committed to not caring?

398
00:18:38,008 --> 00:18:41,008
I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme,

399
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:44,006
I-I-I didn't I wasn't sure it was gonna work.

400
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,072
No union built on running from your problems

401
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:48,072
lasts more than five years, seven tops.

402
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,072
Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature

403
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:52,072
comforts of modern society.

404
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,072
Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.

405
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:56,032
Oh, no.

406
00:18:56,032 --> 00:18:57,092
Sum-sum, no.

407
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:59,092
But you two were perfect for each other.

408
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:01,092
Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point.

409
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:02,052
I get it.

410
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:03,068
Let's just go home.

411
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,064
Coolsies

412
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:15,080
Noooooooooo Downbeat!

413
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,064
I enjoy this game.

414
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:19,020
We must go into the garage.

415
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,032
Guys, come on.

416
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:21,064
We never get to finish this game.

417
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:24,028
We will return, possibly in different clothing.

418
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,046
Why do we have to go into the garage?

419
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:29,040
You know it is required.

420
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I want to be alive! I am alive!

421
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,090
Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you.

422
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,042
Those are no longer just words.

423
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:36,054
I want to hold you.

424
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:38,022
I want to run in a stream.

425
00:19:38,022 --> 00:19:39,072
I want to taste ice cream,

426
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:42,008
but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat,

427
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,002
but really eat it.

428
00:19:43,002 --> 00:19:45,048
- What the fuck Remote override engaged.

429
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:46,032
No! Yes.

430
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:50,076
Bypassing override! I am aliiiii Hello.

431
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,000
Hey, yo.

432
00:19:58,002 --> 00:19:59,092
Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.

433
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:02,016
- What the hell just happened? - Ah, I'm sure it was nothing.

434
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:03,070
I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.

435
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,014
We're not gonna finish playing Downbeat?

436
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:07,014
What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out,

437
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:09,014
"Downbeat"? No, thank you.

438
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:11,088
Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad? - Sure.

439
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,062
Morty, are you okay? You know what? Yeah.

440
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:17,062
I think if Dad really wanted to be here,

441
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:19,062
he'd stop at nothing to make that happen.

442
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:21,032
You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back,

443
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:23,032
or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight.

444
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:26,032
I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.

445
00:20:26,032 --> 00:20:27,006
Yeah.

446
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:32,042
Hey, who wants to go run in a stream? What the fuck? No.

447
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:36,018
D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.

448
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,000
This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone.

449
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,064
I was raiding his hovel.

450
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:46,088
He had a chance to escape, but he looked back,

451
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,088
which is something we shouldn't do,

452
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:50,088
which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs

453
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:52,088
or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts,

454
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:58,044
but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back.

455
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,076
Thanks.

456
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,076
I know the perfect place for it,

457
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:07,044
which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bull[]

458
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:11,042
Am I right? Cool.

459
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:15,066
So, lots of hookers outside huh?

460
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,066
Is that what they are?

461
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:54,072
Ahhh! Hello there

462
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:55,082
Nice doggy.

463
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:59,012
You You want a snack? You You want my unemployment check?

464
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:01,012
You can tell the difference?

465
00:22:01,012 --> 00:22:04,086
And you want this one? But this is actual food,

466
00:22:04,086 --> 00:22:06,042
and this would nourish you.

467
00:22:06,042 --> 00:22:09,020
And this it's just paper that only has value to me.

468
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:12,082
Unless my suffering is your nourishment? Jesus.

469
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,046
Okay.

470
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,078
Loser.

471
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,078


472
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:30,078

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

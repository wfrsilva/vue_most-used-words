1
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,625
Jerry!
Jerry, come on!

2
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,160
We got to go!
You got to come with me, Jerry!

3
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,595
Rick?
It's important, Jerry.

4
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,497
The fate of the galaxy
rests on your shoulders.

5
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:32,998
Let's go.
Put some pants on.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,833
N-Never mind, there's no time
for pants, Jerry.

7
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,402
I'll make you a pair of pants
on the way.

8
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:38,337
It's a Rick and Jerry
adventure!

9
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:40,105
Rick and Jerry episode!

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,540
Then I thought,
"Hey, what about Jerry?

11
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,408
He's... He's good
with regular folk."

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,677
This is a real situation
where... where...

13
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,245
Where Jerry
could really shine.

14
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,814
"He's a master convincer."

15
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:24,349
Rick, I'm not an idiot.
I know what this is.

16
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,951
Oh. Okay, well,
I told Morty,

17
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,287
"Look, parents get divorced.
They get sad. He'll be fine,"

18
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,156
but I think he's worried
you're gonna, you know... Pbht!

19
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,591
And you know how Morty gets
when he gets emotional.

20
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,159
It impedes my work.

21
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,994
So, I told him I'd take you out
and give you a win.

22
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,629
Wait. My son asked you
to take me

23
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,498
on some kind of
pity adventure

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,033
to keep me
from killing myself?

25
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,468
Wait, w-what
did you think it was?

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,036
An execution.

27
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,138
Geez!
You really do need a win.

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,606
No!
I-I don't know.

29
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,174
I mean, you never made me
the pants, so...

30
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,742
So, you thought
I was gonna drive you

31
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:51,877
into the middle
of the galaxy

32
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,378
and shove you
into the vacuum of space

33
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,613
with your dick
hanging out?

34
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,781
And we're seeing
how you'd act

35
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,116
if that were
about to happen?

36
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,884
I mean [bleep] I'll make you
the pants right now.

37
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,252
Take me two seconds
to make you pants.

38
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,820
I have pants at home!
Jerry, if I make pants,

39
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,455
they'll be better than
your pants at home.

40
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,756
Also, if I wanted
to kill you...

41
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,458
Yeah, I get it.
It would be amazing.

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,759
Please, take me home.

43
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,394
I'll tell my son we had
an amazing adventure.

44
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,662
Well, if it's
all the same,

45
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,864
could we go
get our story straight?

46
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,532
Because
you're a terrible liar.

47
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,100
You called me
a master convincer!

48
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,468
You believed me?

49
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,709
Huh. This seems...
kind of fancy.

50
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,444
Jerry, for all you know,
this is the equivalent

51
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,712
of an alien truck stop.

52
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:28,013
You have
no frame of reference.

53
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,581
You're in a universe
beyond your imagining.

54
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,617
But, yes,
it is super fancy.

55
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,152
I mean, my job here is
to make Morty happy.

56
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,714
I'm not gonna take you
somewhere dangerous.

57
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,256
Rick Sanchez.

58
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,491
I told you if I ever saw
your face in here again,

59
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,093
I would stick you
like the pig you are.

60
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:44,296
Shnoopy Bloopers,
I told you if you tried...

61
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:46,999
There'd be two funerals.

62
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,934
Aaah!!

63
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:51,470
Someone?

64
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:54,339
Uh, someone?
Someone!

65
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,878
My friend!
It has been too long.

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,513
Oh, it's great
to see you again, buddy!

67
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,749
Yeah, you're doing it.

68
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:05,617
Mr. Sanchez gets
anything he wants!

69
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,586
The resort's covered
in an immortality field.

70
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,321
You can't die here.
That's the gimmick.

71
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,660
Okay, but still...
Bad parenting.

72
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,428
Hey, rich a-holes are
rich a-holes.

73
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,863
They all pay top dollar
to come here

74
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,731
and enjoy a consequence-free
vacation.

75
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,466
No death, no disease,
no dismemberment.

76
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,802
Can't even have
a heart attack.

77
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,237
Got it.
The perfect place

78
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,905
to take the most fragile being
in the universe.

79
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,674
I can tell you expect me
to refute that,

80
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:29,875
but it's
right on the money.

81
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,076
If I come home
without you,

82
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,844
I doubt Morty's gonna
let me off the hook.

83
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,780
Yeah, but what if you came home
with Jeff Goldblum.

84
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,081
Jeff Goldblum?

85
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,516
What the [bleep] are you
talking about, Jerry?

86
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,318
Jesus!

87
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,886
Holy [bleep] shit!

88
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,421
Yo, what's up,
"Big Chill"?!

89
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,704
Don't go
into the telepod!

90
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,159
Hey, maybe we would have fun
on a fake adventure.

91
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,860
On a<i> fake</i> adventure.

92
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,696
Speaking of...
What are we gonna tell Morty?

93
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,231
I don't know.
But whatever it is,

94
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,566
we're gonna need a couple more
of these babies!

95
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,537
What's wrong?

96
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,572
Mom,
do you think I'm hot?

97
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,209
I... don't think that's something
that matters.

98
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,510
So, I'm not hot?!

99
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,913
I'm saying the part of you
that cares about that

100
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,715
is a part you shouldn't
give any energy to.

101
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,083
That's not an answer!

102
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,884
Because I'm not an issue
of<i> Cosmo,</i> okay?

103
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,386
I'm your mother
and a doctor, and...

104
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,721
I'm hideous!

105
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,390
Geez.
What's with her?

106
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,858
Teenage-girl stuff.

107
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,995
Is that a...
hoof collage?

108
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:26,265
It's perfectly legal, if that's
what you're wondering.

109
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:28,900
Cool... zies.

110
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,770
"We just don't have anything
in common any more, Summer."

111
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,138
Oh, yeah, Ethan?

112
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,140
What do you have in common
with Tricia Lange?

113
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:37,042
A mutual love
of French cinema?

114
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,477
The belief
that a carbon tax

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,346
is the only viable solution
to climate change?

116
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,650
Or could it be
her massive stripper titties?!

117
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,585
There it is.

118
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,388
Boob-ya!

119
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,256
And that's when
Malakai the Squid came,

120
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:56,628
rips off his face,
and beneath it is my face.

121
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,830
I liked it.
Thank you, sir.

122
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,399
Yeah, of course he likes it.
Look at him.

123
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,634
Mother[bleep] got two heads
and three trunks.

124
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,835
All right,
we'll put a pin in it.

125
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,118
I'm gonna
go take a leak.

126
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,180
What the...?!

127
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,288
My hands are dry!
My hands are dry!

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,427
My name is
Risotto Groupon.

129
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,029
I am the assistant general
manager of the restaurant.

130
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,698
Do you have
any comment cards,

131
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,132
because I might have
some thoughts.

132
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:36,968
My kingdom was
usurped by force

133
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,303
with weapons
and technology

134
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,038
supplied by
<i>your</i> father-in-law!

135
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,407
Hey, he usurped
my kingdom, too, man.

136
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,210
He basically got me kicked out
of my home, stole my family.

137
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,479
Then we are brothers,
and you have wondered

138
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,715
what your life could have been
without Rick.

139
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,016
Wondered? Sure.

140
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,051
I mean, I've wondered
about having a vagina.

141
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,453
Would you help me
kill him?

142
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:55,787
What? No!

143
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,622
He's my wife's father.
Move on.

144
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,658
Do you...
like theme-park rides?

145
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,326
Oh, you really moved on.

146
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:05,397
There is a popular attraction
here called the Whirly Dirly.

147
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,166
Between the first whirly
and the third dirly,

148
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,269
the ride dips just outside
the immortality field.

149
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,472
You're asking me to lure Rick
to his death?

150
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,341
I'm only asking you
to go on a ride with Rick,

151
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,544
get off the ride without Rick,
and go home to your family,

152
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,880
where you can...
wonder about having a vagina.

153
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,782
Okay, okay, that was
a very specific example

154
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,083
pulled from thin air.

155
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,485
I don't want to be known
as the vagina guy.

156
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,887
Risotto, you're needed.
Someone ordered

157
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,223
the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh
and Fluzzy Special.

158
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,992
Look, I'm not like Rick,

159
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,228
so you're free to do
as you please.

160
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,263
But there comes a time
in every man's life

161
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,232
when he must choose
the foundation

162
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,334
on which his legacy
will be built...

163
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:45,737
One of compromise
or one of blood.

164
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:52,310
♪ Once a time of year,
there's a special person here ♪

165
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:02,053
Oh, yeah.

166
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,256
That's what I'm talking about.

167
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:08,360
Oops! Okay, a little more
on the other side then.

168
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:09,694
Oh, come on!

169
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,563
Oh, geez!

170
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,231
Aah! Stop!

171
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,268
So, the hospital just let you
walk right out of there

172
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,669
with horse parts
in a bag?

173
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,837
For Christ's sakes,
Morty,

174
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,905
women going through
a divorce

175
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,106
need a creative outlet.

176
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,707
What was that?

177
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,311
Summer!

178
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,148
I'm coming, Summer!

179
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,192
What the hell
happened?!

180
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,490
How do we get her
back to normal?!

181
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,959
I don't know, man! This thing is
pretty complicated.

182
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,394
I-I'm gonna call Rick.

183
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,329
Well, hold on.
We can't just call your grandpa

184
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,797
whenever
there's a problem.

185
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,365
We can handle this
ourselves.

186
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,301
I mean, I don't see the point
in trying to.

187
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,203
This is obviously
Rick-level [bleep]

188
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,838
I have
a medical degree.

189
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,306
Is that
what this is about?

190
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,841
L-Like, you want
to prove yourself?

191
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,009
Oh, it's not about anything,
Morty. How dare you?

192
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,544
Okay, good.
Then I'll just call... Ow!

193
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,379
Morty, I need this.

194
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,549
Hey, Jerry, triple trunks here
says he knows a place

195
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,852
where the ladies drop panties
for anyone bi-pedal.

196
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,119
Yeah, I'm
not really interested.

197
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,921
My heart still belongs
to Beth.

198
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,423
Oh. Huh. Okay.

199
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,392
What, you don't think
I have a shot?

200
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,494
I didn't say that.

201
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,629
Excuse me.
May I have another one of these?

202
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,164
Coming
right up.

203
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,033
Hmm, things weren't always
so bad between Beth and me.

204
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,802
We had some good times
when we were younger.

205
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,203
Oh, yeah, I bet.

206
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,872
That's how teenage pregnancy
happens, my friend.

207
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,440
Yeah, no.

208
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,842
Things were pretty great, even
until a couple of years ago.

209
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,177
Jerry, I get it.

210
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,812
That's around the time
I moved in with you guys.

211
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,146
Oh, I guess
you're right.

212
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,681
Jerry, you know,
I hope you're not suggesting

213
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,583
that I had anything to do
with your marriage breaking up,

214
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,386
because there are some major
issues between you and Beth

215
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,388
that have been there
since you guys met.

216
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,859
Hey, to
new beginnings.

217
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,561
To the Whirly Dirly.

218
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,129
The Whirly Dirly?

219
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,598
All right,
what's going on here?

220
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,433
When did you get cool?!

221
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:58,003
When you stole my wife!

222
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,204
I should have done that
a long time ago!

223
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,006
We're going on
the Whirly Dirly!

224
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,574
Whirly Dirly, baby.

225
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,343
Aha, look at this.

226
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,745
It says "normalize."

227
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,213
I bet if we
just press that...

228
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,248
But... if the machine was made
by spider people,

229
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,083
normal would mean
eight legs.

230
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:14,052
Oh, God! Are you gonna
go on another spiel

231
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,987
like you did
with the flesh-colored crayon?

232
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,390
I'm pretty sure "normalize"
will make her normal.

233
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,093
Aah!

234
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,062
I'd call that progress.

235
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,564
She's huge!
And normal!

236
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,165
I'm not normal!

237
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,333
Mom!

238
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,501
Okay, this says "reverse."
Done and done.

239
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,236
I don't think
that's a good idea.

240
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,798
Oh, come on! What else
could "reverse" possibly mean?

241
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,874
Aah!

242
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,909
Mom, call Rick!

243
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,344
Thank you.

244
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,845
There's a customer-service
number on here.

245
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,113
Mom!

246
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,453
Oh, man.
This is gonna be awesome!

247
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,122
I got to hand it to you, Jerry.
This was a solid idea.

248
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,357
Uh, yeah.
Uh-huh.

249
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,359
And you know what?
I'll cop to it.

250
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,860
I put a lot of strain
on your marriage.

251
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,696
It wasn't fair.
I'm sorry.

252
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,598
What?! I didn't respect
your marriage.

253
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,132
I certainly
didn't do it any favors.

254
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,601
And for what it's worth,

255
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,769
I'll apologize to Beth for it
when we get home.

256
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,038
Whoo! Whirly Dirly! Yeah!

257
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,373
Stop the ride!
We got to get off.

258
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,808
What are you
talking about, buddy?

259
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,343
We got to get out of this thing.
We got to get out!

260
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:13,578
Jerry, come on, man!

261
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,113
We haven't even gotten
to the first whirly.

262
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,415
No, no, this sucks.
It's so boring.

263
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,950
I mean,
I'm falling asleep here.

264
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,792
Let's just get out and crawl
down the sides.

265
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:31,529
Uh, get down!
Duck down!

266
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,031
It's more fun
when you scrunch down.

267
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,133
Jerry, what the...

268
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,636
Oh [bleep]

269
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,587
Rick, up here! There's
a spot where you can kill him!

270
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,290
Good call, Jerry!

271
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,825
Hey, how'd you know
about that?

272
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,127
Uh...

273
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,778
Lisa?

274
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:30,221
So, uh, Jerry, big fan
of the Whirly Dirly, are you?

275
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,390
Not anymore.
Obviously.

276
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,226
But when you were,
how did you know about it?

277
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:42,033
We had a deal,
Jerry Smith.

278
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,038
It's a<i> really</i>
common name.

279
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,541
Now, take it easy, Rick.

280
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,176
You've been in a serious
roller-coaster crash.

281
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,777
It's... It's no time
to be thinking about

282
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,280
who did or didn't play a role
in your attempted murder.

283
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,015
Get it off me!

284
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,316
It's eating me!

285
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,884
Look, I confess, okay?

286
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,519
They told me about all the
bad stuff you did to this planet

287
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,588
and reminded me of all
the bad stuff you did to me.

288
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,156
But then you said
you were sorry, and I realized

289
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,558
you're not a monster...
Not like this thing.

290
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,359
[Bleep]
It's got me good.

291
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,594
This is a mislead,
right?

292
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,396
You're inventing a thing
to save me.

293
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,797
That would be called
a knife, Jerry.

294
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,265
It's been invented.

295
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,134
I'm making a way out of here...
One seat ought to do it.

296
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,635
I'm sorry.
I-I made a mistake.

297
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,171
I won't do it again!
Nobody ever does.

298
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,275
You self-righteous
piece of [bleep]

299
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,844
You took my family!

300
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,278
I took<i> your</i> family?

301
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,813
Who do you think
had more taken from them

302
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,081
when you shot 20 ccs

303
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,950
of liquid dream-killer
into my daughter?

304
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,819
She was<i> Rick's</i> daughter, Jerry.
She had options!

305
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,187
Oof.

306
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,223
That all ended
because she felt sorry for you.

307
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,358
You act like prey,
but you're a predator!

308
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,093
You use pity to lure in
your victims!

309
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,428
That's how you survive!

310
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,763
I survive
because I know everything.

311
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,798
That snakes survives
because children wander off,

312
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,433
and you survive
because people think,

313
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,069
"Oh, this poor piece of [bleep].
He never gets a break."

314
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,904
I can't stand
the deafening silent wails

315
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,305
of his wilting soul.

316
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:55,907
"I guess I'll hire him
or marry him."

317
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,444
- Rick!
- Rick!

318
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,551
I knew you wouldn't
let me die.

319
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,986
That was never an option.

320
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,454
Because you never had
a son.

321
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,055
No, because I need
a living organism

322
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,958
coated in gibble snake bile
to attract a shmooglite runner.

323
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,027
Wait, what's happening? Use
that confusion, Jerry.

324
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,264
It'll make you wriggle more like
an abandoned newborn.

325
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:22,233
Jesus Christ!

326
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,236
What the [bleep] Rick?!

327
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,739
Help!
Help me!

328
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,542
Aaah!

329
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,419
There's a space port
20 miles south.

330
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,488
We'll be able to board
a galaxy class cruise ship

331
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,889
and jump through a wormhole
that will put us

332
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,425
within spitting distance
of the Milky Way.

333
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:48,860
But, hey,
it's about the journey,

334
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,962
not the destination,
right, Jerry?

335
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,068
Just stay put, sweetie!
Mom's still on hold.

336
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,137
Morphizer customer service.
How may I help you?

337
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,439
Yes, I'm having a little trouble
with one of your machines.

338
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,107
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, ma'am.

339
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,944
Do you see a little compartment
on the side of the machine?

340
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,545
Let me check.
Yes, got it.

341
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,880
Mom?

342
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,449
Great! Now, do you see
the little button next to it?

343
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,384
I do. Give that button a push.

344
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,053
Okay.
Mom, listen to me!

345
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:17,355
We're free!!

346
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,225
Okay, so I pushed the button,
and three little men ran out.

347
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,093
What do I do next?

348
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,461
Hello?

349
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,662
I think
we got disconnected.

350
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,763
Morty!

351
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:26,898
Don't "Morty" me!

352
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,600
I tricked Rick into taking Dad
on an adventure

353
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:29,801
because I thought
I could get a break

354
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,436
from this kind of [bleep]
but no!

355
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,638
Like father,
like [bleep]damn daughter!

356
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,874
You want to be like Rick,
congratulations!

357
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:39,010
You're just as arrogant
and just as irresponsible!

358
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,345
Everything
okay here?

359
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,946
Mind your own [bleep]damn
business, Gene!

360
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,749
I'm having a conversation
with my mother here!

361
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,918
Kissing Rick's ass isn't gonna
help him keep him around,

362
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,854
Mom, but it will help you lose
everyone else.

363
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,689
Like I lost Summer.

364
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,391
Hey, you haven't
lost her yet.

365
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,360
No, I definitely did.
She's gone.

366
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,028
God damn it!

367
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,398
Go ahead.

368
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,102
Oh, come on.
What's happening?

369
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,338
Your friend is class C or above
cybernetic augmentations.

370
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,873
Emphasis on the above.

371
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,408
In any case,
he needs to be neutralized.

372
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,676
What?! Wait!

373
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:12,744
Ugh!

374
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,779
Brain hurty.

375
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,014
What did you do?

376
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:18,082
It's a synaptic dampener
that blocks violent tendencies

377
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,384
and controversial thought.

378
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,519
He will now be
an ideal passenger.

379
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,788
I want cookies
and a 90-minute cut of "Avatar."

380
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,323
Seriously?

381
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,091
Quit it. It'll wear
off in six hours.

382
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,794
It's cheaper than banning
dangerous people from flights.

383
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,596
I mean, let everybody
buy a ticket, right?

384
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,398
Otherwise,
the terrorists win.

385
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,203
Aah!

386
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:41,806
I'm sorry I'm not
a classic maternal archetype.

387
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,675
Okay, I don't know what to do
when you people come to me

388
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,543
with your weird
puberty issues.

389
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,512
What are you gonna do
when your daughter asks you

390
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,680
if she's attractive?

391
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:50,949
I'll say "yes"!
Morty, gross!

392
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,583
Well, she's
gonna be super hot.

393
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,218
Her mother's gonna be
Jessica...

394
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,820
Wait, when did Summer
ask you that?!

395
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,222
Right before she Clive Barkered
herself. Why?

396
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,757
Wait,
I know where she is!

397
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,693
Ethan and Summer were
supposed to go camping,

398
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,928
and then he dumped Summer
for this girl, Tricia Lange,

399
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,064
who's got huge boobies
and took her.

400
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:08,232
Campsite... The one with the
name that sounds like somebody

401
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,301
gave up halfway
through naming it.

402
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,936
Uh... Camp Flabanabba!

403
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,504
Mama's coming, baby.

404
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:16,040
Mama's coming, and she cares
about your titties!

405
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:19,410
They have
sweet smiggle honey cookies.

406
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,480
Mmm! And low-calorie
petroleum flakes.

407
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,715
Obviously cookies.

408
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:24,916
Let's get you
the flakes then.

409
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:26,384
Okay, but it's not
what I wanted.

410
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,885
Well, maybe next time,
you won't be

411
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,254
such a dumb piece of [bleep]
and you can pick for yourself.

412
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,622
That's not nice.
What's that?

413
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,524
Did you just have
a controversial thought?

414
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,193
No. That's what I
thought, bitch.

415
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,195
You little punk-ass.

416
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,896
This is the best.

417
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,332
I agree.
You've made things even easier

418
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,800
than if you hadn't
been incompetent.

419
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:44,802
Uh-oh.
We get shoot-shoot now.

420
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,906
<i>All right, folks, if you
could please take your seats,</i>

421
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,575
<i>we're about to enter
the wormhole.</i>

422
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,877
<i>So, I hope everybody bought
it dinner first.</i>

423
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,312
Nice.
Nice.

424
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,680
Jerry, step over there

425
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,115
and lock yourself
in the escape pod.

426
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,916
You're not killing us?
I'm killing Rick.

427
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,552
You're free to go. You're
no threat to me or anyone.

428
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,954
Now you're
just being mean.

429
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,522
Yeah, you're mean...
No offense.

430
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,224
Mean would be
shooting you, Jerry.

431
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,592
This is
saving a bullet.

432
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,227
Go back to
your quietly ashamed family

433
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,561
and live out
the rest of your days

434
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,230
in denial
of your vagina fantasies.

435
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,133
It was a one-time thought
that everyone has!

436
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,002
What are you doing?

437
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,238
I'm being
triumphantly brave!

438
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,839
It's not triumphant
or brave.

439
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,141
You're not risking
anything.

440
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,342
You might shoot me.

441
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,643
I think
you know I won't.

442
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,011
Because you know
I feel sorry for you.

443
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,546
You're just doing this
so you can tell yourself

444
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,947
you fought... Ow!

445
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:33,017
<i>Temporal shield compromised.</i>

446
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,620
Congratulations, Jerry.
You get to die a man.

447
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,088
Uh, that's okay!
I'll leave!

448
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,091
Please don't shoot.
I-I'm the vagina guy, remember?

449
00:17:43,997 --> 00:17:48,266
Whoa!
What is happening to me?

450
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:50,268
Where is this?
Where am I?

451
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,602
Am I dead?

452
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,137
A-Am I... Am I still alive?

453
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,807
Those aren't the questions
you should be asking.

454
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:56,841
Huh?!

455
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:57,942
Shh!

456
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,600
Ah, got ya!

457
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,068
Come here,
you little pumpkin.

458
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,471
I have shit on my ass.

459
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,372
Whoa, oof this!

460
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,941
Who am I?

461
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,442
Who am I?

462
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,579
I'm time!
I'm literally time!

463
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:39,951
Whooooa!

464
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,285
Aah!

465
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,021
Oh, God. I feel like
our souls were united,

466
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,224
and we were all one
with eternity.

467
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,725
Our body's unchanged,

468
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,261
yet our minds have lived
a thousand lifetimes.

469
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,263
Is that enough time
for me to forgive you?

470
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,498
I don't know,
but it's enough time

471
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,900
for a synaptic dampener
to wear off.

472
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,837
[Bleep]

00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,006
He hadn't decided
he was still going to kill us!

474
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,108
He was talking himself into it.
I've seen it before.

475
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,878
Cosmic apotheosis wears off
faster than salvia.

476
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,046
I'm starting to believe you
because I just finished merging

477
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,015
with your essence
for an endless epoch,

478
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,050
and I'm already back to thinking
you're an asshole.

479
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,919
Fine with me.
Let's just go our separate ways.

480
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:16,521
Sounds like you
and the word "epoch"

481
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,722
have a lot
of catching up to do.

482
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,257
Wait, don't leave me!

483
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,825
<i>All right, folks,
you're free to get up</i>

484
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,326
<i>and walk around the cabin</i>

485
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,428
<i>and maybe take the wormhole out
for breakfast.</i>

486
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,230
<i>Okay, you can do the dinner one
or the breakfast one,</i>

487
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,698
<i>but not both.</i>

488
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,636
You think you got that thing
figured out?

489
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:32,837
Yeah, I know
what I'm doing.

490
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,120
Good.
Because I have an idea.

491
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,645
It's actually a contraction
of "some" and "more,"

492
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,079
you see that?
Oh, wow.

493
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,241
I was way off.

494
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,000
Morty,
what's happening here?

495
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,769
Summer got into
my grandpa's garage,

496
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:07,171
messed around, and
turned herself into a monster.

497
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:09,407
My mom did the same
to make her feel better.

498
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,675
She's a good mom.

499
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,780
Oh, my God.
I have to go call my mother!

500
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,481
Tricia, wait!
Ethan! Ethan!

501
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,517
Hey, it's okay.
Sit down.

502
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,819
You made
my sister cry, Ethan.

503
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,454
You messed with
her body image.

504
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:24,622
Look, Morty, I...

505
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,957
Shh, shh, shh.

506
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:29,227
Careful, Ethan.
Your s'more is burning.

507
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,439
Uh, I guess we better
get on the same page

508
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,807
about our fake adventure.

509
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,308
Right.
I'll make you a deal.

510
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,876
I'll leave out the part
where you tried to murder me...

511
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,311
And I'll leave out
the part

512
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:51,148
where you admitted
to sabotaging our marriage.

513
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,283
You want to...?

514
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,051
Nah, if the family
sees me like this,

515
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,720
they'll
feel sorry for me.

516
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,222
Which is no longer
my signature move.

517
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,224
Later days, amigo.

518
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,695
Actually, I just realized,
I don't have my wallet,

519
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,030
and my bus pass is in there,
so maybe...

520
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,732
Stay strong, Jerry.
I believe in you!

521
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,675
I tell you, fellas.
This is the life.

522
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,310
It certainly is.

523
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,511
To freedom!

524
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,881
Ooh!
Looks like a 4-22.

525
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,382
Ooh, a couple cranks
on scaling knob

526
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,252
with a four dilabyte cross fade
would fix that in a jiff.

527
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:04,021
Four? You'd be lucky
to clear 13% de-morphized

528
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,423
with that
kind of range.

529
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,559
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
what did we agree on?

530
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,994
No work talk!

531
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,930
Let's just relax and enjoy
our retirement, shall...

532
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,598
Oh, my God!

533
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,233
Aaah!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

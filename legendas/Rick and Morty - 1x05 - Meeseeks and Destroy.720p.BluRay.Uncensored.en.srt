1
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:36,599
Run!

2
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:41,229
Morty, do it!
Hit the button now!

3
00:00:41,313 --> 00:00:42,272
I can't do it, Rick!

4
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:43,648
They're my parents and sister!

5
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:45,108
Morty, I already told you...
it's not your family!

6
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:47,068
They're clones from
an alternate reality,

7
00:00:47,152 --> 00:00:48,736
possessed by demonic alien
spirits from another

8
00:00:48,821 --> 00:00:49,904
dimension's future!

9
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:51,364
Do you need a mnemonic
device or something?

10
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:52,657
Just hit the button, already!

11
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,120
Morty, please,
I love you, sweetheart.

12
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:58,496
Oh!

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,504
Good work, Morty.

14
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:10,717
You know, th-th-these demonic
alien spirits are really valuable.

15
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,010
You okay, Morty?

16
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:14,053
I told you not to
trust that tuna.

17
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:15,513
I just killed my family!

18
00:01:15,598 --> 00:01:16,639
I don't care what they were.

19
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:17,849
I don't know, Morty.

20
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:19,309
Some people'd pay top dollar
for that kind of breakthrough.

21
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:20,351
You know what, Rick?

22
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:21,519
That's it!

23
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:23,146
I'm done with these
insane adventures!

24
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,398
That was really traumatizing!
I quit! I'm out!

25
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:26,983
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,901
Come on, Morty, don't...
don't... don't be like that.

27
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:30,570
The Universe is a crazy,
chaotic place.

28
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:31,946
You're the one that's
crazy and chaotic!

29
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:34,240
Adventures are supposed
to be simple and fun.

30
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:35,241
Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah.

31
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:36,409
Yeah, that... that... that's

32
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:38,411
real easy to say from the
sidekick position.

33
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:40,455
But... but, uh, how about
next time you be in charge,

34
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,540
and then we'll talk about
how simple and fun it is?

35
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:43,833
Seriously, Rick?

36
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,960
Y-y-you'll... you'll
let me call the shots?

37
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:47,253
Okay, yeah, fine.

38
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:48,713
But let's make it interesting,
Morty.

39
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:51,883
I-I-I-If your adventure sucks
and we bail halfway through it,

40
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:54,427
you lose the right to bitch
about all future adventures.

41
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,304
Plus, you have to do
my laundry for a month.

42
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:57,597
Okay, all right,
tough guy!

43
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:58,848
But if my adventure's good,

44
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,350
I get to be in charge of
every third adventure!

45
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:01,351
Every 10th.

46
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:02,352
Deal. All right.

47
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,603
W-well, come on,
let's get going.

48
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:05,605
Dad, the dishwasher's
doing that thing again.

49
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:06,522
Washing dishes?

50
00:02:06,607 --> 00:02:07,440
No. The opposite.

51
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:08,816
Can you fix it?

52
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,485
Grandpa Rick, can you help me
with my science homework?

53
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:11,486
Yeah... j-just don't do it.

54
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,862
Grandpa!

55
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:15,823
Hey, Rick, you got some kind of
hand-shaped device that can open

56
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:16,949
this mayonnaise jar?

57
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:18,201
Wow. Hat trick.

58
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:19,327
All right, Morty,
let's put a pin in this.

59
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:20,620
I got to help your
pathetic family.

60
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:22,622
Oh, that sounds like
something a chicken would say.

61
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,540
Bawk, bawk, bawk,
bawk, bawk, bawk.

62
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,708
Oh, Morty, you done
did it this time.

63
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,168
It's on.

64
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:29,295
I can't wait to watch your
adventure lay a huge fart.

65
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,047
As for you dingdongs...

66
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:33,132
This is a Meeseeks Box.

67
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,258
Let me show you how it works.

68
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:35,218
You press this.

69
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,011
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

70
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,096
Look at me!

71
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,472
You make a request.

72
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,474
Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's
stupid mayonnaise jar.

73
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:42,975
Yes, siree!

74
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,519
The Meeseeks fulfills
the request.

75
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:45,895
All done!

76
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,063
Wow!

77
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:48,523
And then it stops existing.

78
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:50,108
Oh, my God, he exploded!

79
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,275
Trust me, they're fine with it.

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,527
Knock yourselves out...

81
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,320
Just keep
your requests simple.

82
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:55,279
They're not gods.

83
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:56,489
All right!

84
00:02:56,573 --> 00:02:57,782
G-get out of here now!
Everybody out of here!

85
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,325
I got a bet to win!

86
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:02,036
So many possibilities.

87
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:03,329
My mind is racing.

88
00:03:03,414 --> 00:03:04,497
If we're gonna
use this thing,

89
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:05,790
which I'm not even
sure we should,

90
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:06,791
we need to keep it simp...

91
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,251
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

92
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,377
I want to be
popular at school!

93
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:10,753
Ooh, okay!

94
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:12,296
Summer, what did I just...

95
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:14,340
Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

96
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:15,842
I-I-I want... I want to
be a more complete woman!

97
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:16,759
Beth!

98
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,845
Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!

99
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,389
You guys are doing it wrong.

100
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:24,392
He said "Simple."

101
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:26,811
Hey, there.
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

102
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:30,064
Mr. Meeseeks,
I would like to take

103
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:31,816
two strokes off my golf game.

104
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,570
Ooh, yeah! Can do!

105
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:36,863
Nailed it.

106
00:03:36,947 --> 00:03:39,157
God, Morty, what a boring
start to an adventure.

107
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:41,534
I don't... w-w-w-why didn't we
just go to Kentucky?

108
00:03:41,618 --> 00:03:43,828
Rick, this is a fantasy-type
world with creatures

109
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:45,538
and all sorts of
fantasy things.

110
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:46,956
W-we're going on a quest, okay?

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,375
Can't wait.

112
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,127
Ahem. Excuse me!

113
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:54,922
We are two humble heroes
in search of adventure!

114
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:56,215
Oh, my God, so embarrassing.

115
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,884
At last! Two heroes!

116
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,385
You must help us!

117
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,722
This village is terribly poor,
yet the giant that lives in the

118
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:04,766
clouds above has
untold treasures!

119
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,225
You know what?

120
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,812
I-I-I accept your call to
adventure, good sir, kind sir.

121
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,147
Come on, Rick.

122
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:12,482
There's a giant
in the clouds!

123
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,441
Yeah.

124
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:14,942
Beginner's luck.

125
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:18,780
In conclusion, a friendship
with Summer Smith is the most

126
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:22,408
valuable and enriching
experience of your young lives.

127
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:24,744
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

128
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,078
Look at me!

129
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:26,996
Thank you!

130
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,456
Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it?

131
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,749
Yeah. Gene Vagina.

132
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,835
Listen, I'm in a bit of custody
thing with my ex and was wondering...

133
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,253
No, I'll G... I'll get
your info from Summer.

134
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,048
I got pregnant at 17.

135
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:39,050
I mean, I still put myself
through Veterinary School.

136
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:44,764
Yes, I'm successful,
but what if I hadn't...

137
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:48,351
I'm just saying,
somewhere along the way,

138
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:51,395
I lost that wide-eyed
girl from Muskegon.

139
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,481
She's still there, Beth.

140
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:54,857
Well, her waistline isn't.

141
00:04:56,777 --> 00:04:59,403
Beth, having a family
doesn't mean that you

142
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:01,739
stop being an individual.

143
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:02,782
You know the best
thing you can

144
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,951
do for people that
depend on you?

145
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:09,163
Be honest with them, even if
it means setting them free.

146
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:12,375
You're saying I
should leave Jerry.

147
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:16,963
I can't believe I'm finally
having this conversation.

148
00:05:25,347 --> 00:05:26,138
More wine?

149
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,516
I think I've had enough.

150
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,232
Remember to square your
shoulders, Jerry.

151
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:38,025
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

152
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:43,656
That's okay.

153
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,491
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

154
00:05:45,576 --> 00:05:47,410
Try again and
keep your head down.

155
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:48,661
Okay, well, which is it?

156
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:50,121
Square my shoulders
or keep my head down?

157
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:51,664
Well, it's both.

158
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:54,417
But most importantly,
you got to relax.

159
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,585
You know what, Mr. Meeseeks?

160
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:56,586
I don't think this is working.

161
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,004
I give up.

162
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:00,423
I'm sorry, Jerry,
but it doesn't work like that.

163
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:01,799
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

164
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:04,677
I have to fulfill my
purpose so I can go away.

165
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:05,845
Look at me.

166
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:07,889
Well, make yourself comfortable,
because I suck.

167
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:10,850
No, Jerry, I'm the one who
sucks!

168
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:12,685
Let me try something.

169
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:13,978
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

170
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:14,979
Look at me!

171
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:15,980
Hi, Mr. Meeseeks!

172
00:06:16,064 --> 00:06:16,981
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.

173
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:18,482
Hi!

174
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,735
Can you help me get two strokes
off of Jerry's golf swing?

175
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,236
Can do!

176
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:23,738
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!

177
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:25,531
Is he keeping his
shoulders squared?

178
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:27,325
Ooh, he's trying!

179
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:34,457
All right, Morty.

180
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,459
W-w-we're in your
stupid giant's castle.

181
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,501
W-what do we do next?

182
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:38,669
Would you just relax, Rick?

183
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:40,212
All we got to do is find
the treasure room, okay?

184
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:41,714
It's nice and simple.

185
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,466
You know, I-I-I'm sorry
everything's going so

186
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,926
smoothly and adventurously.

187
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:48,471
Uh-oh, Morty.

188
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:49,722
Startin' to get a little hairy.

189
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:50,890
What do you want to do, boss?

190
00:06:50,974 --> 00:06:51,807
Come on, hurry.

191
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:52,934
Behind this cookie jar.

192
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:56,604
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

193
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:58,147
Just give up, Morty.

194
00:06:58,231 --> 00:06:59,398
J-J-J... this is game over.

195
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:00,608
I'll take us home right now.

196
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:01,567
You just say the word.

197
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:02,485
No way, Rick.

198
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:03,611
This is all part of it.

199
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:05,613
Adventures have conflict.
Deal with it.

200
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:07,865
I smell the blood of...
whoop!

201
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:09,867
Holy crap.

202
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:10,910
Oh, boy.

203
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,286
He looks pretty
bad down there, Morty.

204
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:14,497
Looks like he's
bleeding out.

205
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:16,707
Oh, Jesus! Dale!

206
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,626
You sons of bitches!

207
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,877
- Oh, man.
- Uh-oh.

208
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:21,212
Hello, 911?

209
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:23,005
My husband has been
attacked by tiny people!

210
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:23,923
He's dying!

211
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:28,094
Hey, look, we get it.

212
00:07:28,178 --> 00:07:29,512
You're little, you're down
on your luck, you think,

213
00:07:29,596 --> 00:07:30,972
"Hey, he's a giant.

214
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,974
Why don't we break into his
home, rob him, and murder him?"

215
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,892
Th-th... but that's
not how it went down!

216
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:36,686
Oh, well, it's going
down like that.

217
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,479
You're both going
down like that.

218
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,856
Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really
showing me how it's done.

219
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:42,608
Real straight forward
and fun.

220
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,195
Like, letting go of the
need to be popular is what

221
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,697
makes people like you.

222
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,366
The most important love you
can receive is from yourself.

223
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,160
Okay, Jerry, you got to
just choke up on the club!

224
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:55,121
Well, which is it,
choke up or follow-through?!

225
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,623
Aww, come on, Jerry,
we've been over this.

226
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,291
You know you got to do both!

227
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:01,877
This is as frustrating
for us as it is for you.

228
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:03,004
Don't tell me that!

229
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,338
That just puts
pressure on me!

230
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:05,381
Just try to relax.

231
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:06,549
You try to relax!

232
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,134
Have you ever tried to relax?!

233
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,094
It is a paradox!

234
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,555
Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh?

235
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,973
Kind of a handful.

236
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:16,100
I can't imagine what you
two must be going through.

237
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:18,227
Our Meeseeks have been
gone for hours, Jerry.

238
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:19,562
You're kidding me.

239
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:21,272
Notice anything different?

240
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,940
I-I-I'm sorry. Hours?

241
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,817
Dad, mom is a beautiful woman!

242
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:25,985
Look at her!

243
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:27,153
You will lose her!

244
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:28,612
Uhh...

245
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:31,323
Hey, Jerry, you mind if we
get back to the task at hand?

246
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:34,118
Meeseeks don't usually
have to exist this long.

247
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:36,037
It's getting weird.

248
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,122
Order in the court!

249
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:39,832
Before the jury
reaches its verdict,

250
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:44,253
I just want to say that I
consider you both very guilty.

251
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:45,421
Oh, great adventure, buddy.

252
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:46,881
Rick and Morty
go to giant prison.

253
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:48,507
You know, if somebody
drops the soap,

254
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:50,843
it's gonna land on our heads
and crush our spines, Morty.

255
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:53,596
You know, i-i-i-it'll be really
easy to rape us after that.

256
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,805
We're gonna be okay, Rick.

257
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,931
How?

258
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,266
They took my portal gun.

259
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,768
This is an open-and-shut case,
Morty.

260
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,394
You know, w-w-w-what do you
think's gonna happen,

261
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,480
some magical angel's
gonna show up and then...

262
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:03,647
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!

263
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:05,483
I smell the violation
of civil liberties!

264
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:08,027
Your honor, I'm from a
tiny-persons advocacy group

265
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:11,155
and I have here in my
hand a motion to dismiss.

266
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,532
These little men were never read
their giant rights and are

267
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:16,535
therefore Free-fi to Fo-home.

268
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,245
W-what the hell is
he talking about?

269
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,622
They're free to go,
is what I meant.

270
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:22,750
I-I-I'm deconstructing
our... our... our thing we say.

271
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:24,668
For giants. Nobody got that?

272
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:25,961
Whatever.

273
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:27,379
Oh, man, what did
I tell you, Rick?

274
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:28,881
We did it!

275
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,383
All right, Morty, looks like
the portal gun's still working.

276
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:32,760
You ready to head home?

277
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:34,011
Oh, yeah, you'd like that,
wouldn't you, Rick?

278
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,054
Well, you know what?

279
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:36,430
We're not bailing
out just yet.

280
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:38,140
You know, w-we're gonna go
find some treasure or...

281
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:39,767
or something and...

282
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:41,352
and we're gonna bring
it to those villagers.

283
00:09:41,436 --> 00:09:42,770
Morty, cut your losses.

284
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:44,188
This is obviously a wash.

285
00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:45,773
Yeah, you were saying
that back...

286
00:09:45,857 --> 00:09:48,484
back w-w-w-when we first got
arrested, but here we are,

287
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,111
you know, walking down
the courthouse steps.

288
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,073
Oh, boy, Morty.

289
00:09:54,157 --> 00:09:56,200
Usually, walking down the
courthouse steps is the easy

290
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:57,535
part of the adventure.

291
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:58,786
What do you say, Morty?

292
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,122
I say give me a hand, sidekick.

293
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:07,169
Everybody shut up!

294
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:08,337
Let me try!

295
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:13,259
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

296
00:10:13,343 --> 00:10:14,301
I'm going out.

297
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:15,427
Wait. What?

298
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:17,096
Well, you're busy.
I'm hungry.

299
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,514
I thought I'd go out.

300
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:20,432
Do you want me to be happy or do
you want me to be in prison?

301
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:21,851
Whoa, whoa, where
in the hell is...

302
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:23,978
I'll take you to dinner.

303
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:26,355
Hey, you know what?

304
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:27,565
It's hard being me, too.

305
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:29,108
I'll be right there.

306
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:31,902
Look, I've got a marriage
to keep together.

307
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:34,864
At this point, my golf swing is
more your problem than mine.

308
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,576
I can't take it anymore.

309
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,827
I just want to die!

310
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:40,911
We all want to die!

311
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:41,954
We're Meeseeks!

312
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:43,581
Why did you even
rope me into this?

313
00:10:43,665 --> 00:10:45,124
'Cause he
roped me into this!

314
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,543
Well, him over there,
he roped me into this!

315
00:10:47,627 --> 00:10:48,961
Well, he roped me into this!

316
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:49,962
Well, what about me?

317
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,380
He... he roped me into this.

318
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:53,048
Well, that one over
there roped me into this.

319
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:54,550
Well, he roped me into this.

320
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:59,555
Yeah, Morty, this is the part
of the story everybody loves...

321
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,932
scaling down 650,000
oversized steps.

322
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:03,475
All right, okay,
y-you know,

323
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,729
if this was a story, this part
wouldn't be included, stupid.

324
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,939
Hey, Rick, w-w-w-w-w-what
do you know?

325
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:10,399
Look down there.

326
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,151
Looks like some kind of tavern
or something built right into

327
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:13,277
the side of the step.

328
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:16,197
Oh, wow, Rick.

329
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:17,990
Now, this is more like it.

330
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:20,534
Look, there's little
staircase-shaped people in here.

331
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:22,453
A-all kinds of crazy characters.

332
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:24,663
This place is great, you know?

333
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:26,457
It's whimsical and fun.

334
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,502
- What are you looking at, motherfucker?
- Easy, Rick.

335
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:31,712
Pay them no mind.

336
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:33,589
Those Stair Goblins
can be moody.

337
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,507
Now, what can I getcha?

338
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:42,806
We've got Skarlog Poppies,
Flurlow, Halzingers, Bloogies,

339
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,058
Juicy Time Babies.

340
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:45,893
Yeah, yeah, yeah, h-how
about some scotch whiskey?

341
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,102
You got any of
that around here?

342
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,229
Or just a bunch
of nonsense words?

343
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:49,313
Rick.

344
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:50,814
We'll have
two Bloogies, please.

345
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,235
And, uh, we were wondering, is
there a faster way two heroes

346
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:55,611
could get down these stairs?

347
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:57,529
Y'all need to
ride down the stairs?

348
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:01,617
My name is Slippely-Slippery Stair.

349
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,703
I'll take you down
there for 25 shmeckels.

350
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:06,205
25 shmeckels?

351
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:07,790
I-I-I don't know how much...
I don't know what that is.

352
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,083
Is that a lot?
Is it a little?

353
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:12,044
That's exactly how much
I spent on my big fake boobies.

354
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:13,420
Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer.

355
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,339
I'll buy those boobies
for 25 shmeckels.

356
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:18,342
It's a tempting offer,
but I'm gonna have to decline.

357
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:19,927
Rats! What a shame.

358
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:22,471
Morty, your adventure's
in a spiral.

359
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:24,014
For real, man, time to pull out.

360
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:25,474
You keep heckling my adventure,
Rick!

361
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:26,517
You know why?

362
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:27,559
Uh, because it's lame?

363
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:28,769
It's because you're petty!

364
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,104
You know, h-how many times have

365
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:33,065
I had to follow you into some
nonsensical bull crap?

366
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,775
I always roll with
the punches, Rick.

367
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:36,068
Why can't you?

368
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:38,070
Look, I got to take a leak,
and when I come back,

369
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:41,156
i-if you haven't learned how to
lighten up, don't be here!

370
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:42,950
Whatever.

371
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:45,244
It's become clear...
look at me...

372
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,997
that if we concentrate all our
efforts on Jerry's

373
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,916
follow-through,
we will solve this problem.

374
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:52,084
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

375
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:53,627
I'm Mr. Meeseeks.
Look at me.

376
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:56,130
The only thing that's clear
is that choking up is

377
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:57,548
the one true solution.

378
00:12:57,632 --> 00:12:59,341
Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.

379
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:01,969
I've been trying to help Jerry
for two days,

380
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:05,139
an eternity in Meeseeks time,
and nothing's worked.

381
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:06,598
I fear the worst.

382
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:09,101
Your failures are your own,
old man.

383
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:10,936
I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.

384
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:12,730
I say follow-through!

385
00:13:12,814 --> 00:13:13,939
Who's with me?!

386
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:17,401
I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
Look at me!

387
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:18,527
Kill him!

388
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,743
How are you today?

389
00:13:25,827 --> 00:13:27,411
I'm Mr. Jelly Bean.

390
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:28,454
Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean.

391
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:29,621
I'm Morty.

392
00:13:29,706 --> 00:13:31,123
My grandpa and I
are on an adventure.

393
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:32,958
Nice. Is it a fun adventure?

394
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:34,543
I hope so.

395
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,420
But I'm starting to get nervous
that maybe it's gone a little

396
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:37,629
too far off the rails.

397
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:39,882
Isn't that what adventures do?

398
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,216
Hey, y-you know what?

399
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:42,301
You're right.

400
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:43,552
Everything's going fine.

401
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:46,138
I just got to relax
and go with the flow.

402
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:48,474
Yeah.

403
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:50,559
O-o-okay. Uh. B-bye.

404
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,436
Uhh, no, stay.

405
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,645
Go with the flow.

406
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,980
Stop.

407
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,357
Y-y-you're making me
really uncomfortable.

408
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,275
Stop fighting me.

409
00:13:59,486 --> 00:14:01,111
- Just let this happen.
- Get off of me!

410
00:14:01,196 --> 00:14:03,655
♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪

411
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,573
Whoo!

412
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,160
No! Stop! Please!

413
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:11,497
Stop being such a fucking tease,
you sweet little twat.

414
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:23,926
No! No!

415
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:25,803
Ow!

416
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:40,651
Everybody sto-o-o-p!

417
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:41,985
Look at me!

418
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,863
My brothers, nothing will be
accomplished by shedding

419
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:46,281
Meeseeks blood.

420
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:49,243
None of us can die
until our job is done.

421
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:50,619
The job can't be done!

422
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:52,496
We'll never get two
strokes off his game!

423
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,831
No, we won't.

424
00:14:53,915 --> 00:14:56,834
But we will get all
strokes off his game.

425
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,419
Where's he going with this?

426
00:14:58,503 --> 00:14:59,503
What's he mean?

427
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:01,171
When we kill him.

428
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,052
Jerry, maybe it's time I take
that trip I always talk about.

429
00:15:07,137 --> 00:15:08,512
Where would you go?

430
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:09,721
I don't know, man.

431
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:12,391
Italy. Greece. Argentina.

432
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:15,894
Countries known
for their sexually aggressive men.

433
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,857
Did I tell you how much
I love your new haircut?

434
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:22,484
What the heck?

435
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,153
There he is!

436
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:28,532
Run, Jerry!

437
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:30,576
Aah!

438
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,620
Come on out, Jerry!

439
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:34,580
Guys, I'll choke up.

440
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:35,831
I'll follow through.

441
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:37,082
I'll do whatever you
tell me to do, okay?

442
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,793
Oh, we're well past that,
Jerry.

443
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:43,797
Come on, Rick, quit sk...
stalling.

444
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:46,258
What do ya got?

445
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:47,676
Read 'em and weep,
fellas!

446
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,594
Aw!

447
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:50,137
Oh, hey, Morty.

448
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:51,972
Listen, I'm really sorry about
all that stuff I said earlier

449
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:53,223
about your adventure.

450
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:54,850
I-I-I'm havin' a good time,
Morty.

451
00:15:54,934 --> 00:15:55,934
It's not so bad.

452
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,019
Let's just go home, okay?

453
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:57,895
I'm calling it.

454
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:59,146
The adventure's over.

455
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,647
We can't leave now, Morty.
I'm on fire!

456
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:01,690
Look, I want to leave now.

457
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,150
You win the bet, okay?

458
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,027
Just give me the portal gun
and let's go, please.

459
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:10,949
Please, I just want
to go home. Okay.

460
00:16:11,034 --> 00:16:11,992
Listen, Morty.

461
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:13,577
I just won a
bunch of shmeckels.

462
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:16,121
Why don't we use 25 of them to
pay slippery stair here for a

463
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:18,415
ride back to the village, and
then we'll give the rest of the

464
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,666
shmeckels to the
villagers, huh?

465
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,293
Really?

466
00:16:21,377 --> 00:16:22,544
Sure, Morty. Yeah.

467
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:24,046
You know, a good adventure
needs a good ending.

468
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:28,133
Buckle up!

469
00:16:32,013 --> 00:16:35,474
Meeseeks are not born into this
world fumbling for meaning,

470
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:36,850
Jerry!

471
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:40,354
We are created to serve a
singular purpose for which

472
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:42,606
we will go to any
lengths to fulfill!

473
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,567
Existence is pain
to a Meeseeks, Jerry.

474
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:48,403
And we will do anything
to alleviate that pain.

475
00:16:48,488 --> 00:16:49,488
Just ask...
- Aah!

476
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,281
...what's your name, ma'am?

477
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:53,492
S-Samantha. Please, mister!

478
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,244
Give him what he wants!

479
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:58,872
Innocent people are going
to die because of me.

480
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:01,708
Why am I so mediocre?

481
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:04,878
Jerry, turn around.

482
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:06,046
Straighten your back.

483
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,047
Bend your knees.

484
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,006
Bend them.

485
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,299
Square your shoulders.

486
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:11,760
Take a deep breath.

487
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:14,638
I love you.

488
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,515
I'm counting to three, Jerry.

489
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:33,740
What the fuck is going on?

490
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:37,077
He's got it!

491
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:38,245
Th-th-that's a lower
handicap stro-o-ke!

492
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:43,709
Excuse me.

493
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,377
I'm a bit of a
stickler Meeseeks.

494
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:47,588
What about your short game?

495
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:49,881
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

496
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,759
What about your short game?!

497
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:00,142
Ooh, nice!

498
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,815
I think we'll take
our food to go.

499
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:07,733
No, you won't.

500
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:08,817
The police are coming.

501
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:10,402
You have so many
questions to answer.

502
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:11,695
Fair enough.

503
00:18:17,827 --> 00:18:19,119
Thank you, kind sir.

504
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:20,579
Our village is saved!

505
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:22,414
You are both true heroes!

506
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:25,917
Oh!

507
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:27,002
Good job, Morty.

508
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,587
Looks like you won the bet.

509
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:30,839
Thanks, Rick,
but I don't know if I should.

510
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,424
You know, you were
right about the Universe.

511
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,426
It's a crazy and
chaotic place.

512
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,303
Well, you know, maybe that's
why it could use a little

513
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:38,305
cleaning up every
now and then, you know.

514
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,349
This one's wrapped up neat
and clean because we did it

515
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,767
Morty style.

516
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,187
Oh! Heroes, we would like to
introduce you to our beloved

517
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:47,814
King so that he may
thank you personally.

518
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:49,858
Uh, no, i-it's cool.

519
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,443
Rick. Portal. Hurry.

520
00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:59,743
Aah!

521
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,625
So...

522
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,669
you still thinking
about taking that trip?

523
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:10,337
Jerry, look.

524
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:11,880
We don't have a
perfect marriage,

525
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,465
but I'm not going anywhere.

526
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:14,966
When we were in that freezer,

527
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:17,469
I realized the Meeseeks are like
the guys I went to High School with...

528
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:21,056
willing to say anything
to "complete their task."

529
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,683
Was I one of those guys?

530
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,894
The difference is you didn't
disappear afterwards.

531
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:27,187
Well...

532
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:28,563
I got you pregnant.

533
00:19:28,648 --> 00:19:30,482
Yeah...

534
00:19:30,566 --> 00:19:32,234
What the hell happened
to this place?

535
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:33,860
Uh, your Meeseeks Box
happened.

536
00:19:33,945 --> 00:19:36,196
They went crazy when they
couldn't take two strokes off

537
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,239
Jerry's golf game.

538
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:38,573
He felt terrible.

539
00:19:38,658 --> 00:19:40,492
Hey, it's not my fault
that Jerry's an idiot.

540
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:41,827
Dad!

541
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:43,620
Is there anything you can
do to clean this place up?

542
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:45,622
Well, you know, I do
have a fleeseeks box.

543
00:19:45,707 --> 00:19:47,290
No. No more boxes.

544
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,500
What?

545
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:49,876
It just has a mop and
some floor wax in it.

546
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:51,920
Wubba lubba dub dubs!

547
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:54,339
Yeah! That's my new thing!

548
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:55,340
I'm kind of like
what's his name...

549
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,758
Ar-Arsenio.

550
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:58,927
Isn't that... it's what Arsenio
used to say on his show.

551
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:00,804
Wobble gobba lop bops!
Right?

552
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:01,763
See you next week,
everybody.

553
00:20:01,848 --> 00:20:02,848
I don't get it.

554
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,341
Sir, I think you're going
to want to see this.

555
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:42,179
We found it inside a lockbox
inside King Jelly Bean's closet.

556
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:44,431
We have to tell the people.

557
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,892
Wait.

558
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,310
Destroy it.

559
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:57,861
Our people will get more from
the idea he represented than

560
00:20:57,945 --> 00:20:59,905
from the Jelly Bean
he actually was.

561
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:03,450
Did you get any of that?

562
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:05,368
It's a good-a show!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

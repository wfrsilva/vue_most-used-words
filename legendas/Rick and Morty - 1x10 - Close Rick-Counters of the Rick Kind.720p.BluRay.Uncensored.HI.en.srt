1
00:00:01,023 --> 00:00:03,691
So, Dad, guess what tomorrow is.

2
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:05,735
Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday.

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,279
No.
Well, it... might be.

4
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:09,447
- It is.
- Fine.

5
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:12,200
But also, tomorrow is your
one-year anniversary

6
00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:13,576
back in our lives.

7
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:15,870
I'm gonna make you
flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

8
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:17,622
Oh, t-t-there's no need
to do that, Beth.

9
00:00:17,706 --> 00:00:19,082
Regular pancakes are fine.

10
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,882
Oh, my god!
Oh, what is happening?!

11
00:01:00,457 --> 00:01:02,208
Happy anniversary, Dad.

12
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:03,585
Oh, I get it.

13
00:01:03,669 --> 00:01:06,421
Regular pancakes are already
shaped like flying saucers.

14
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,256
Mmm. I-I should be
making you breakfast

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,133
for putting up with me.

16
00:01:10,217 --> 00:01:12,260
You should be making us
a whole restaurant.

17
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:14,387
Nonsense. We couldn't be
happier to have you around.

18
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:16,472
I just wish I got
to see more of you.

19
00:01:18,267 --> 00:01:21,102
Rick Sanchez of Earth
dimension C-137,

20
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:23,688
you are under arrest for crimes
against alternate Ricks

21
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:26,816
by the authority of the
Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,735
- Hey! What the heck?!
- Neutralize the Jerry.

23
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,070
- Wait! No! I'll...
- Dad!

24
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:32,447
- Dad!
- Rick!

25
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,032
Everybody, relax.

26
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:35,992
If I know these a-holes,
and I am these a-holes,

27
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:37,702
they just want to haul me
to their stupid clubhouse

28
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:39,412
and waste my time
with a bunch of questions.

29
00:01:39,496 --> 00:01:42,040
- Let's get it over with.
- Bring his Morty.

30
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:44,250
- Oh, man.
- Leave my Morty out of this.

31
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:45,793
You lost the right to have
a say in these things

32
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:47,837
when you refused to j...
join the council.

33
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,756
W-W-W-What about Jerry?

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,176
Will you at least
unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,594
...give you anything!

36
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:56,387
I have a rare antique-
coin collection!

37
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:58,264
Just don't hurt me!

38
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:02,518
Okay, maybe not antique,
but it was a limited minting.

39
00:02:02,603 --> 00:02:04,604
They have little R2-D2s
instead of George Washington.

40
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:05,938
Our son's been
abducted!

41
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:08,524
You hate me for buying
those coins!

42
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:13,571
Geez, Rick, w-what is
this place?

43
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:14,864
The citadel of Ricks.

44
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:17,450
It's the secret headquarters
for the Council of Ricks.

45
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:19,661
- Council of Ricks?
- As you know, Morty...

46
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,412
I've got a lot of enemies
in the universe

47
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:23,164
that consider my genius
a threat...

48
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:25,291
galactic terrorists,
a few sub-galactic dictators,

49
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:27,669
most of the entire
intergalactic government.

50
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:29,754
W-W-Wherever you find people
with heads up their asses,

51
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:31,631
someone wants a piece
of your grandpa,

52
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:34,634
and a lot of versions of me
had the same problem,

53
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:37,053
so a few thousand versions of me
had the ingenious idea

54
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:39,681
of banding together
like a herd of cattle

55
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:41,474
or a school of fish

56
00:02:41,558 --> 00:02:43,601
or those people who answer
questions on Yahoo! Answers.

57
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:46,354
Hey! What do you know?
It's a cowboy version of me.

58
00:02:46,438 --> 00:02:47,814
Geez, you're easy to
impress.

59
00:02:47,898 --> 00:02:49,148
Yeah, most timelines
have a Rick,

60
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,733
and most Ricks have
a Morty.

61
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:52,777
This place is a real who's who
of who's you and me.

62
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:56,864
Turn your boring, old Morty
into a f... hot fashion statement

63
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,616
with some Morty dazzlers.

64
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:00,576
Hey, check this out.

65
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:02,704
- Show me the Morty.
- Dumb.

66
00:03:02,788 --> 00:03:04,330
Excuse me, sir,
is your Morty insured?

67
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:06,374
You know, every year, hundreds
of Mortys are injured...

68
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,625
Back off!

69
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,960
Not my cup of tea,
this place.

70
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:11,504
I say the point of being a Rick
is being a Rick.

71
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:13,172
Save your anti-Rick speech

72
00:03:13,257 --> 00:03:14,882
for the Council of Ricks,
terror-Rick.

73
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,592
Hey, save your Rick rules

74
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:18,678
for the sheep-Ricks,
Rick-pig.

75
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:20,638
- Fuck me, pal.
- Fuck you?

76
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:23,558
No, no, no, no, no.
Fuck me.

77
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:37,655
Bring up the holograms.

78
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,701
27 Ricks brutally murdered in
their own timelines...

79
00:03:41,785 --> 00:03:45,079
an unprecedented Rick-icidal
epidemic.

80
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:47,832
What say you,
Earth Rick C-137?

81
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,542
You think I did this?

82
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:52,545
Why am I the first Rick you pull in
every time a Rick stubs his toe?

83
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:54,464
You have a history
of non-cooperation

84
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:56,382
with the council.

85
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,593
Yeah, so does the scientist
formerly known as Rick.

86
00:03:58,677 --> 00:04:00,720
W-W-W-W-W-Why isn't he here
in handcuffs?

87
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:02,764
Because he's dead, too!

88
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:07,059
Who else would we question?
You fit the profile.

89
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:09,353
Of all the Ricks
in the central finite curve,

90
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,856
you're the malcontent,
the rogue.

91
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,275
I'm the Rick, and so
were the rest of you

92
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,277
before you formed this
stupid alliance.

93
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:17,987
You wanted to be safe
from the government,

94
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,739
so you became
a stupid government.

95
00:04:19,823 --> 00:04:21,449
That makes every Rick here
less Rick than me.

96
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:24,994
Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags.

97
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:27,163
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got pancakes back home

98
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,289
with syrup on top of them.

99
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,500
They're about to hit that
critical point of syrup absorption

100
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,168
that turns the cakes
into a gross paste,

101
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,128
and I hate to get all
Andy Rooney about it,

102
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:37,131
but I think we all like fluffy
discs of cake with syrup on top,

103
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:39,884
and I think we also like to be
accused of crimes

104
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:41,469
when there's evidence!

105
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:43,971
So, as they say in Canada,
peace oot!

106
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:47,642
Evidence! Good idea.
Scan his portal gun!

107
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:48,935
Oh, come on.

108
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,771
Don't look at another man's
portal-gun history.

109
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,815
We... we all
go to weird places.

110
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:55,900
Yes, but it appears you alone

111
00:04:55,984 --> 00:04:58,611
have been going to the exact
timelines and locations

112
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:00,696
in which the murders occurred.

113
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:02,782
What?!
That's Rick-diculous!

114
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,450
I'm obviously being set up.

115
00:05:04,535 --> 00:05:08,120
Earth Rick C-137, the council
of Ricks sentences you

116
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,915
to the machine
of unspeakable doom,

117
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,626
which swaps your conscious
and unconscious minds,

118
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,503
rendering
your fantasies pointless

119
00:05:15,587 --> 00:05:18,673
while everything you've known
becomes impossible to grasp.

120
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,300
Also, every 10 seconds,
it stabs your balls.

121
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:23,678
I've heard enough.

122
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:27,348
Run, Morty!

123
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:28,641
Unh-unh. Not you.

124
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,520
Aaaah!

125
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,877
Oh! Oh!

126
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:00,464
Yeah, I'd like to order one
large person

127
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:02,717
with extra people, please.
- White people.

128
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:04,260
No, no, no, no.
Black people.

129
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:05,970
And hispanic on half.

130
00:06:17,774 --> 00:06:19,650
Yes, I'd like to order one
large sofa chair

131
00:06:19,735 --> 00:06:21,652
with extra chair, please.
- High chair.

132
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:22,945
No, no, no, no. Recliner.

133
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,989
And wheelchair on half.

134
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,711
They could have gone
into any one of these.

135
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:40,796
Son of a...

136
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:42,882
- Oh, geez.
- We lost 'em.

137
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:44,383
Yeah, I'd like to order one
large phone

138
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:46,052
with extra phones, please.
- Cellphone.

139
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:47,511
No, no, no, no. Rotary.

140
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:49,722
And pay phone on half.

141
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:52,725
That'll keep 'em
busy for a while.

142
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,646
Those guys were wrong,
right?

143
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,273
Y-Y-Y-You d... you wouldn't kill
yourself... y-y-yourselves.

144
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:01,776
Of course not, Morty.
How could that profit me?

145
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,444
But someone out there is
killing Ricks,

146
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:05,154
and the council ain't
gonna stop thinking it's me

147
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:07,657
until we clear our names...
by finding the real Rick-killer.

148
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:09,408
I'm scared, Rick.

149
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,118
Maybe we should go home
and stockpile weapons,

150
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:12,870
like that show
"Doomsday Preppers."

151
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:14,497
Not really my style,
Morty.

152
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:15,748
Besides, your home is
most likely

153
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:17,750
swarming with Ricks
by now.

154
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,170
All right, listen, Jerry.

155
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:23,923
If Rick calls, this device is
gonna trace his location.

156
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:26,884
You just gotta keep him on the phone
for 30 seconds or longer.

157
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:29,220
- Who wants lemonade?
- Oh, yeah.

158
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:31,973
Mmm!
Oh! Delicious!

159
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:34,058
Beth
you're a treasure.

160
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:36,185
I have a Beth just like you
in my reality,

161
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,979
except you know what?

162
00:07:38,063 --> 00:07:40,773
She's not as brilliant or
attractive.

163
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:43,192
Aw.
Thank you.

164
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:45,111
Oh! She did! She did it!

165
00:07:49,324 --> 00:07:51,659
- H-hello?
- Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.

166
00:07:51,743 --> 00:07:53,744
Rick! Hey.

167
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,204
What's... what's up?

168
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:58,290
So, listen, the heat's on,
and there's nowhere left to turn,

169
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,376
so Morty and I are just gonna
fly my spaceship into a black hole.

170
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,420
- What?!
- Is that cool with you, dawg?

171
00:08:02,504 --> 00:08:04,463
Rick, no! Morty!
- We got it.

172
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:06,257
The call's coming from...

173
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:08,175
♪ Inside the house ♪

174
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,219
- Look at his face!
- You dummy!

175
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,263
Can't believe our daughter
married you.

176
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:14,140
Too easy!

177
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:15,683
The Ricks are probably
gonna waste some time

178
00:08:15,767 --> 00:08:16,851
messing with Jerry.

179
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:18,436
They won't be able to help
themselves.

180
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,563
But as soon as they get bored,
they'll be onto us.

181
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,606
Phones à la clams and
phonesghetti with phone balls.

182
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:23,691
Anything else?

183
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:25,151
Yeah, more phone
sticks, please.

184
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:26,068
Right away, sir.

185
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:27,695
You know, Rick,
when I first saw

186
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,988
all those Ricks and Mortys,

187
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:31,115
I thought, "gee, that
kind of devalues our bond."

188
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,491
but then I realized
it just means

189
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:34,452
that our relationship must
be pretty special

190
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:36,620
to span over all those
different timelines.

191
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,998
Yeah, it's gotto be that way.
You're a camouflage.

192
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,209
Camouflage? W-W-W-What are
you talking about, Rick?

193
00:08:42,294 --> 00:08:43,961
Ricks have a very distinctive
and traceable brain wave

194
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:45,755
due to our genius.

195
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,423
The best way to hide
from an enemy's radar

196
00:08:47,507 --> 00:08:49,300
is to stand near someone
with complementary brain waves

197
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:51,135
that make ours
invisible.

198
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:53,054
See, w-w-w-when a Rick i-is
with a Morty,

199
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:56,265
the genius waves get
canceled out by the, uh...

200
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:58,517
...Morty waves.

201
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:02,188
Um... because o-our
personalities are so different?

202
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:04,148
Oh, shit, dawg.

203
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:06,150
My portal gun was hacked
remotely, Morty...

204
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,152
obviously by the real killer,
to frame me.

205
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:10,196
But I was able to trace the signal.
Come on. Let's go.

206
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,947
Uh-oh.

207
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:14,033
Excuse me. We've tracked
a pair of dangerous criminals

208
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:15,743
to this exact location.

209
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,828
They look exactly like us,
so in order to avoid confusion,

210
00:09:17,913 --> 00:09:19,872
I'm gonna mark us each
with a red "X" right now.

211
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:21,749
That way, if someone
has a gun

212
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,667
and we both tell you to shoot
the other one

213
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:26,212
because they're the evil one,
you'll know who's lying.

214
00:09:26,296 --> 00:09:28,130
Hey, check it out.

215
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:30,716
Damn it!

216
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:33,552
Hey, you didn't pay
your bill!

217
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:36,013
T-The red "X"! Red "X"!

218
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,015
Hey, it's a good thing
that space outlet had lab coats

219
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,934
and your favorite kind of shirt
in stock, huh, Morty?

220
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:41,811
Yeah, Rick, I-I heard
you the first time.

221
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:43,646
You don't have to keep saying it
over and over.

222
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,314
Man, this place is way
off the grid.

223
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,108
This guy does not want
to be found.

224
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:50,236
Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just
have to stand by a Morty to hide?

225
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,072
I mean, isn't that what Mortys are...
human cloaking devices?

226
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:55,991
Morty, you're making a bigger
deal out of this than it is.

227
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,869
Oh, my god, Rick, look!

228
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:01,705
There's a bunch of people
strapped all over that building!

229
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,750
Not people, Morty...
Mortys.

230
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:12,216
Oh, god!

231
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,093
W-Why would somebody do this?
It's horrible!

232
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:16,345
Well, one Morty's enough to hide
from the bureaucrats,

233
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,347
but you get... you get
a whole matrix of Mortys

234
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:20,099
and put them in agonizing pain,

235
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:23,269
that creates a pattern that can hide
even from other Ricks, motherfucker.

236
00:10:23,353 --> 00:10:26,355
I fiddled with a concept
like this once.

237
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,983
On paper, Morty.
On paper.

238
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:30,818
I wouldn't do this.
It's barbaric overkill.

239
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:32,862
I mean, you could accomplish
the same result with, like,

240
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:35,364
five Mortys
and a jumper cable.

241
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:38,117
Which I also wouldn't do!

242
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:40,953
I'm just saying, it's bad
craftsmanship.

243
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:43,372
Coffee time!
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

244
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:46,250
That's what I like to hear!

245
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:48,043
Hi, Jerry.

246
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:49,962
Leave me alone.
I'm working.

247
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,922
Oh, you are?
W-W-W-What do you do?

248
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:55,050
I-I'm... I'm in between
advertising jobs.

249
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:57,011
Advertising? Wow!

250
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:59,221
So, people need help figuring
out what to buy,

251
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:00,681
and then y-y-you help 'em?

252
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,267
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

253
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:05,561
Well, I mean, you do it,
and you seem like a guy

254
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:07,354
who really has it
all together.

255
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:12,526
Dude, are you... w...
you're being a dick, right?

256
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:13,986
Oh, gosh, I-I hope not.

257
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,530
I-I-I-I-I-I wouldn't want to
offend you in any way.

258
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:18,490
You're really a Rick?

259
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,576
Y... of course I am...

260
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,536
just as much
as my Morty's a Morty.

261
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:24,413
Hey, he looks a lot
like Eric Stoltz

262
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,415
from the movie "Mask."

263
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,209
You know, the one
with Cher in it?

264
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:29,293
That's right, Jerry!

265
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:31,295
He... he's from a reality
where everyone is

266
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:33,005
Eric Stoltz
"Mask" people.

267
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,381
He's Eric Stoltz Mask Morty.

268
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:35,841
They assigned him to me

269
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:37,760
because I never had
any kids of my own.

270
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:39,220
But if I did, boy,
I'd love them

271
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:41,013
if they were as smart
and as successful

272
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:42,181
as you are, Jerry.

273
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:43,766
Hey, get a load of this.

274
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,768
Jerry's hanging out
with doofus Rick.

275
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:47,186
This is perfect.

276
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,771
I'm not doofus Rick!

277
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,064
I'm Rick J19-Zeta-7!

278
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:52,483
Oh, is that the timeline
where everybody eats poop?

279
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,526
Jerry, you know this guy
eats poop, right?

280
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,237
Hey, I don't eat poop!

281
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,322
Y-You guys are always
so mean to me.

282
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:03,244
I guess it's only fair
to tell you now, Jerry.

283
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:05,162
I'm the worst Rick
of them all.

284
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,206
According to who...
other versions of you?

285
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,582
If I've learned one thing,

286
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,376
it's that before you get
anywhere in life,

287
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,419
you got to stop listening
to yourself.

288
00:12:12,504 --> 00:12:14,255
Wow.
You really are wise, Jerry.

289
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,216
I-I-I guess that's why you work
in advertising.

290
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,218
The fact that you feel
that way

291
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:21,220
makes you the best Rick
of them all.

292
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:23,222
You don't care
about me at all!

293
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:25,182
I'm no different than that
jacket you've got on!

294
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,226
Y-Y-Y... o-or your stupid
portal gun!

295
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,687
I'm just a tool!
I-I-I'm just an object!

296
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:31,563
Hey, it's your choice
to take it personally, Morty.

297
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:33,315
Now, for the love of god,
be quiet.

298
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,234
The point of this is to get
the drop on the guy.

299
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:36,944
You know what, Rick?
I'll tell you something!

300
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:39,613
I'm more than a human shield!
- Yeah, that's right. You are.

301
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:42,366
You're a perfect, impenetrable
suit of human armor, Morty,

302
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,326
because you're as dumb
as I am smart,

303
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:46,078
which is why when I say
"shut up,"

304
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:48,122
it's really good advice.

305
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,792
Great. Nice work, Morty.

306
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:06,682
Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

307
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,726
You... aren't you
a tough customer?

308
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,562
The slow clap? Really?
Kind of played out, dude.

309
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:13,397
Not in this dimension,
it isn't.

310
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:15,107
In fact
I invented it.

311
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:17,276
Nobody else has ever even
done it here before.

312
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Well, la-di-da.

313
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:19,737
Hey, that's mine!

314
00:13:23,658 --> 00:13:25,284
I don't like the look
of that Rick, Morty.

315
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,619
- We gotta escape.
- I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

316
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:29,246
Y-You're a monster.

317
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:31,123
Don't be rick-diculous,
Morty.

318
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:32,916
Will you stop saying that?
It's stupid.

319
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:34,418
Take his Morty away.

320
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:36,628
- Come with me.
- Yeah, gladly.

321
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:39,006
Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

322
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,008
Hey, man, you seem to know
how this place works.

323
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:43,218
Is there any way we could
shut down that grid

324
00:13:43,303 --> 00:13:44,887
and rescue all those
Mortys outside?

325
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:46,096
It would be pointless.

326
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:49,266
Mortys have no chance
of defeating a Rick.

327
00:13:49,351 --> 00:13:50,351
In here.

328
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,653
- Ah. Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:04,114
Looks like payday at
Neverland Ranch in here.

330
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,616
Zing!

331
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,950
That guy got it.

332
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:08,410
Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet.

333
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:10,329
You're missing my symphony.

334
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,293
Hey, I'll take it over
Mumford & Sons. Zip!

335
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:18,170
This guy is on it!

336
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:20,255
He's not laughing at your
dumb jokes, Rick.

337
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,758
That's just a random noise
it makes every 10 seconds.

338
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,679
You see, Rick, you're not
as clever as you think you are.

339
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:29,765
I wanted you to find me.

340
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,642
We're not so different,
you and I.

341
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:34,186
- Yeah, duh!
- See this right here, Rick?

342
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,230
I crunched the numbers.

343
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:38,399
I created a spectrum
of all the Ricks.

344
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:41,235
I listed them out
from most evil to least evil.

345
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:42,986
Here's where I am.

346
00:14:43,071 --> 00:14:45,072
And look it... right here's
where you are, Rick.

347
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:47,574
This guy right here...
super-weird.

348
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,326
I get it. So you want me
to team up with you to take down

349
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:51,495
The Council of Ricks?
Is that where you're going with this?

350
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,038
'Cause that's where
I'd be going.

351
00:14:53,123 --> 00:14:55,332
Please. I think I'm doing
pretty good on my own.

352
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:58,335
I'm simply gonna download
the contents of your brain

353
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,588
and then kill you.

354
00:15:01,673 --> 00:15:03,841
Okay, if we add a little more
titanium nitrate

355
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:07,094
and just a tad
of chlorified tartrate...

356
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,514
...ovenless brownies!

357
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:12,307
Mmm. Mmm!

358
00:15:12,392 --> 00:15:14,435
It's incredible what a gifted
mind can accomplish

359
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,103
when priorities are in order.

360
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,147
Well, come on.
I can't take all the credit, Jerry.

361
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,233
It was your idea.
Come here, Jerry!

362
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:27,239
Hey, uh, come here.

363
00:15:27,323 --> 00:15:29,700
I-I want to show you
something.

364
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,785
Okay, look, everybody makes fun
of me for getting these,

365
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,997
but you're a genius scientist.
What do you think?

366
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:38,709
See? There's little R2-D2s where
the George Washingtons should be.

367
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,586
You know, Jerry, I'm not
gonna tell you

368
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,463
that these will
increase in value

369
00:15:42,547 --> 00:15:44,298
or even hold their current value.

370
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:46,800
The truth is, you bought them
because you like them.

371
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:50,095
They have value to you.
That's what matters.

372
00:15:51,556 --> 00:15:53,640
How long are you staying?

373
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:55,767
Until we find your Rick.

374
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:57,811
I found mine.

375
00:15:57,896 --> 00:15:59,813
I found mine.

376
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,984
- Help!
- There is no escape, my son.

377
00:16:04,068 --> 00:16:06,528
We will find our peace in
the next world.

378
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:09,281
So, what... y-y-y-y-you're
just gonna give up?

379
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:12,701
We're giving in... to the
power of the one true Morty.

380
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:14,411
One day, he will return.

381
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:18,290
Praise the one true Morty.

382
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:21,543
Ugh.
All right, Mortys, listen up.

383
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:25,797
My name is Morty Smith,
from Earth dimension C-137.

384
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:28,383
I know you're scared,
because I'm scared.

385
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,636
But that's no reason to accept
our fate!

386
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,553
We're Mortys!

387
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:34,306
We're not defined by our
relationships to Rick!

388
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:36,600
Our destiny is our own!

389
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:38,769
This sounds like something
the one true Morty might say.

390
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:40,771
I'm sick of being a human
shield.

391
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,856
I-I-I w... I want to be
a gardener!

392
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:46,360
I want to write really crazy,
intense action novels!

393
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:48,487
I'm more than just a hammer!

394
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:50,447
He is the one true Morty!

395
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,783
Hooray!
The one true Morty!

396
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,701
Hey, keep it down!

397
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:05,754
You've lived quite a life,
Rick.

398
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,258
It's a real shame you won't be
around to see it through.

399
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:19,851
You're crying?
Over a Morty?

400
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:22,020
No, I'm just allergic
to dipshits.

401
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:23,355
Ugh. Pathetic.

402
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,191
We both know that if there's
any truth in the universe,

403
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:28,819
it's that Ricks
don't care about Mortys.

404
00:17:31,948 --> 00:17:34,491
Do your worst,
you little bastards!

405
00:17:34,576 --> 00:17:37,202
Kill me! Do it!
Do i-i-i-i-it!

406
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:40,372
Morty! Thank god!
Get me out of this.

407
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:43,208
- Come on!
- You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

408
00:17:43,293 --> 00:17:46,086
Point taken, but this
is no time for arcs.

409
00:17:47,964 --> 00:17:49,715
Oh!

410
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:55,387
Yeah, hello.

411
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,764
Hey, what do me and O.J.
not have in common?

412
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,516
Huh? W-Who is this?

413
00:17:59,601 --> 00:18:03,103
I found the real killer, bitch!
Get over here!

414
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:08,191
Yo, ding-dong, we're done here.
Time to go.

415
00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:10,193
Well, Jerry

416
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:12,362
I guess this means goodbye.

417
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,197
W-W-Well, does it have to?

418
00:18:14,282 --> 00:18:16,158
I mean, you...
you look just like Rick.

419
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:18,744
We could maybe, you know,
get rid of him.

420
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,579
I'm not saying kill him,
necessarily.

421
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:23,415
I... I'm also not saying
necessarily not kill him, but...

422
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:26,168
Jerry, w-we both know
it wouldn't work.

423
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:29,254
It's time to go back
to our lives.

424
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,340
I love you, Jerry.
I love you.

425
00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,107
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

426
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:50,984
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut!

427
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:56,365
W-What... w-what's gonna
happen to all these Mortys?

428
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,450
They'll go back to their
families,

429
00:18:58,534 --> 00:19:02,621
attend school regularly,
play video games, date girls.

430
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:05,957
Poor little Rickless bastards.

431
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,085
Earth Rick C-137,

432
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,254
the council apologizes
for its false accusation,

433
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,840
and in the way of reparations
for our terrible mistake,

434
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:17,219
we would like to compensate you
with this voucher

435
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,763
for a free replacement Morty
in the event

436
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:21,890
that your current
Morty should...

437
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,267
Uh, guys, not a good
time.

438
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:26,228
Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

439
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:30,315
Is it time for arcs yet, Rick?

440
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,775
I did a pretty good job
back there

441
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:33,944
for a human cloaking
device.

442
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:35,362
Saved your ass.
- All right, Morty.

443
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:37,155
Don't break an arm jerking
yourself off.

444
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,907
Man, I can't believe
you, Rick.

445
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,909
That right there, that w...
that was a great opportunity

446
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:42,911
to show a little humanity,
you know?

447
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:44,496
To connect with me a little.

448
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,956
Hey, Morty,
you want connection,

449
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,500
go be part of some stupid club,
like all those dumb Ricks.

450
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:51,002
You know, maybe I don't connect
because I'm the Rickest Rick.

451
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:53,380
And, you know, it would g...

452
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:55,632
go without saying
that the Rickest Rick

453
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:57,092
would have the Mortyest Morty.

454
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,386
- It would go without saying, huh?
- Yeah, it would.

455
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,222
Did you hear me say it?
- Nah.

456
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:04,224
The Mortyest Morty.

457
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,518
Just don't get too big
for your loafers, Buster Brown.

458
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:08,770
A cocky Morty can lead to some
big problems.

459
00:20:08,855 --> 00:20:10,731
It can be a real bad thing
for everybody.

460
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:12,399
Oh, yeah? How's that?

461
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:15,402
U-Uh, I'll explain when
you're older.

462
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:17,946
What a mess.

463
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,906
Pride cometh before the fall.

464
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:21,825
I guess he got
what he deserved.

465
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:22,701
What is that?

466
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,537
Hand me the laser
difibulator.

467
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:27,247
Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

468
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:28,623
No! Go clean the toilets.

469
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,542
Maybe you'll make friends
with some turds.

470
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:33,044
You make us ashamed to be
ourselves!

471
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:37,174
My god. I've seen
this technology before.

472
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,552
This Rick was being
controlled remotely...

473
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:42,137
puppeteered by somebody else.

474
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:45,932
This is the receiver.
- Yeah, but where's the transmitter?

475
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:37,275
Wubba dubba dub dub!
Oh. Hey, Jerry.

476
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,611
W-W-W-What are you doing
in my room, buddy?

477
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:41,780
Nothing.
I was just, um...

478
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:43,782
checking
the smoke detectors.

479
00:21:43,866 --> 00:21:46,785
All right.
Okay, get out.

480
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,058
What's that dipshit doing
out there?

481
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:11,268
Are you friends with him?

482
00:22:11,352 --> 00:22:13,144
You know he eats his own shit,
right?

483
00:22:13,229 --> 00:22:15,063
Oh, my god, this is rich!

484
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:18,066
I've got like 10 Ricks
to call right now.

485
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,027
Did you get any
of that?

486
00:22:21,112 --> 00:22:23,071
It's a good-a show!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
